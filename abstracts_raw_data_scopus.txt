ABSTRACT: Aesthetic experience is an important aspect of creativity and our perception of the world around us. Analogy is a tool we use as part of the creative process to translate our perceptions into creative works of art. In this paper we present our research on the development of an artificially intelligent system for the creation of art in the form of real-time visual displays to accompany a given music piece. The presented system achieves this by using Grammatical Evolution, a form of Evolutionary Computation, to evolve Mapping Expressions. These expressions form part of a conceptual structure, described herein, which allows aesthetic data to be gathered and analogies to be made between music and visuals. The system then uses the evolved mapping expressions to generate visuals in real-time, given some musical input. The output is a novel visual display, similar to concert or stage lighting which is reactive to input from a performer. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

ABSTRACT: Facial expressions are connected to experiencing emotions according to Facial-Feedback Theory of Emotion developed by Charles Darwin and William James [17]. Knowing how to read and interpret facial expressions helps us understand how human beings connect with one another in mobile-mediated communication (MMC) and improve our own abilities at managing emotions. There have been multiple types of research conducted that study and compare factors that influence facial emotion recognition in humans [10]. As one of the most prominent channel in human interactions, facial expression is a good indicator of a person’s emotions. Recent technological advancements have had a drastic impact on human interaction. Besides face-to-face chat, video chatting become more and more popular in the digital age. This research provides to understand how video, voice and music influence emotion perception in the MMC context among different user groups. In this research, we evaluated challenges and effectiveness between two primary emotions: happiness and sadness in video chatting. This study analyzed the emotional influences of voice and music on video chatting and its effectiveness on sensing others emotional energy. Participants were from 18–42 years old and 98% of participants are in between 18–32 years old. A series of visual stimuli were created with four models were from Gen Z; Millennial; Gen X; and Baby Boomer. In addition, the research examines the comfort level with different relationships (e.g. friends; acquaintances; and strangers) in the video chatting environment. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2019.

ABSTRACT: In life as in language, living beings act in ways that are multiply constrained as history works through them both directly and as mediated by what we identify as structures (e.g. genes or words). Emphasising direct effects, we replace the ‘language metaphor of life’ with the view that language extends the domain of the living. Just as a living proteome system manages without central control, so does language. Both life and language enable living beings to expand into –and create – new domains or Umwelten. Pursuing the parallel, we link emphasis on fitness with Berthoz's notion of simplexity and the distributed view of life/language/cognition. The semiosphere evolved, we suggest, as systems found novel ways of tapping into the bio-ecology's energetics. Accordingly, there are striking parallels between how regulatory genes influence body structures and how, in humans, community histories re-echo during conversation. In both cases, cross-talk prompts living systems to re-enact a lineage/community's music (or ‘worldviews’). While rejecting Berthoz's residual neuro-centrism, we find 'simplexity’ to be a powerful heuristic. Instead of proposing a single explanatory principle (e.g. computation, autonomy), lineages and communities build on meaning by altering ways of coordinating/cooperating. In all cases, life and language co-operate to bring forth new possibilities. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: The priorities of dressing have broadened and become more complex over the years, creating challenges in developing new products. The technological evolution allied with its democratization has provided new possibilities for experimentation in the area of fashion and clothing in order to meet the current complex expectations. The article presents the experimental development of a transdisciplinary fashion product, which proposes the expansion of the communicability of dance through technological stage design. According to the metalinguistic concept allied to the computational logic pre-established in a project plan, the proposed product has, attached to a ballet costume, sensors to capture movements and transform them into light and colors with different intensities, through direct interaction with the movement direction and intensity. As a result, the LIGHTness project explores the forms, interactivity and light effects of ballet, emphasizing the dichotomy between strength and lightness in this type of dance. © 2019, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: The ubiquity of music across cultures as a means of emotional expression, and its proposed evolutionary relation to speech, motivated researchers to attempt a characterization of its neural representation. Several neuroimaging studies have reported that specific regions in the anterior temporal lobe respond more strongly to music than to other auditory stimuli, including spoken voice. Nonetheless, because most studies have employed instrumental music, which has important acoustic distinctions from human voice, questions still exist as to the specificity of the observed “music-preferred” areas. Here, we sought to address this issue by testing 24 healthy young adults with fast, high-resolution fMRI, to record neural responses to a large and varied set of musical stimuli, which, critically, included a capella singing, as well as purely instrumental excerpts. Our results confirmed that music; vocal or instrumental, preferentially engaged regions in the superior STG, particularly in the anterior planum polare, bilaterally. In contrast, human voice, either spoken or sung, activated more strongly a large area along the superior temporal sulcus. Findings were consistent between univariate and multivariate analyses, as well as with the use of a “silent” sparse acquisition sequence that minimizes any potential influence of scanner noise on the resulting activations. Activity in music-preferred regions could not be accounted for by any basic acoustic parameter tested, suggesting these areas integrate, likely in a nonlinear fashion, a combination of acoustic attributes that, together, result in the perceived musicality of the stimuli, consistent with proposed hierarchical processing of complex auditory information within the temporal lobes. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Encoding models can reveal and decode neural representations in the visual and semantic domains. However, a thorough understanding of how distributed information in auditory cortices and temporal evolution of music contribute to model performance is still lacking in the musical domain. We measured fMRI responses during naturalistic music listening and constructed a two-stage approach that first mapped musical features in auditory cortices and then decoded novel musical pieces. We then probed the influence of stimuli duration (number of time points) and spatial extent (number of voxels) on decoding accuracy. Our approach revealed a linear increase in accuracy with duration and a point of optimal model performance for the spatial extent. We further showed that Shannon entropy is a driving factor, boosting accuracy up to 95% for music with highest information content. These findings provide key insights for future decoding and reconstruction algorithms and open new venues for possible clinical applications. © 2018 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Actors, sportspeople, and politicians may be idolised for their appearance, personality, skills, or ideals. The idolisation of musicians additionally involves transcendental musical emotions. Fans devote extraordinary amounts of time, energy and money to following, empathising with, identifying with and imitating their idols. During great performances, fans experience altered states of consciousness. Existing evolutionary approaches can explain social dominance hierarchies but not specific fan behaviours. Another approach involves the mother schema: the perceptions, cognitions, and emotions that the late foetus and early infant (3rd and 4th trimesters) associate with the mother and her changing behaviours and physical/emotional states. The mother schema was an evolutionary response to the fragility (altriciality) of human infants, born earlier due to a larger brain and upright gait. Active reciprocal interactions between infants and carers (e.g. motherese) involve both the carer’s infant schema and the infant’s mother schema. In later life, the typical emotions of the mother schema are evoked by stimulus patterns reminiscent of the mother as perceived by the infant. In ritual situations, where the focus is on shared subjectivity, similar patterns and emotions are created. Evolutionary by-products of the mother schema include musical behaviours, religious behaviours and musical idol worship. The theory can explain why musical idols are perceived as all-loving, all-knowing and/or all-powerful, and is consistent with psychosocial functions of music and religion such as social cohesion and identity, collective motivation, empathy and mood regulation, catharsis and coping, distraction and entertainment, conflict resolution, and skill transfer. © The Author(s) 2018.

ABSTRACT: Celebration, frustration, contestation and imagination all manifest themselves when examining the evolution of the field of Medical and Health Humanities (MHH) at the University of Cape Town (UCT). That this field has been growing at the same time as access to, inclusion in, and social justice issues linked to higher education have come under the spotlight has the potential to shape how we think and plan for the future of the field. Doing this will require treks up hills, journeys through difficult histories and dynamic dances in-between disciplines.This article examines MHH at UCT broadly, referring to projects and programmes that are underway primarily in the humanities and health sciences faculties. From this overview, the article specifically examines the curricula changes introduced in the Faculty of Health Sciences inspired by MHH and the author's interest in historical consciousness. It describes current points of intervention in physiotherapy and MBChB undergraduate curricula; and through short-term special study modules that have allowed those interested in MHH to explore relationships between health and healing and art, music, writing, yoga, PhotoVoice, drama, drawing and complex histories.It discusses some of the challenges of introducing humanities teaching into health sciences curricula; and some of the tensions that result from the meeting of divergent epistemologies and pedagogies. The article considers if, and how, MHH might engage with social (in)justice, and inclusions and exclusions and potentially offer a balm to soothe the bruising effects of oppressive histories and a hegemonically hierarchical present. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018.

ABSTRACT: Compatibility between host cells and heterologous pathways is a challenge for constructing organisms with high productivity or gain of function. Designer yeast cells incorporating the Synthetic Chromosome Rearrangement and Modification by LoxP-mediated Evolution (SCRaMbLE) system provide a platform for generating genotype diversity. Here we construct a genetic AND gate to enable precise control of the SCRaMbLE method to generate synthetic haploid and diploid yeast with desired phenotypes. The yield of carotenoids is increased to 1.5-fold by SCRaMbLEing haploid strains and we determine that the deletion of YEL013W is responsible for the increase. Based on the SCRaMbLEing in diploid strains, we develop a strategy called Multiplex SCRaMbLE Iterative Cycling (MuSIC) to increase the production of carotenoids up to 38.8-fold through 5 iterative cycles of SCRaMbLE. This strategy is potentially a powerful tool for increasing the production of bio-based chemicals and for mining deep knowledge. © 2018 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Context. The Shapley Concentration (z) ≈ 0.048) covers several degrees in the southern hemisphere, and includes galaxy clusters in advanced evolutionary stages, groups of clusters in the very early stages of merger, fairly massive clusters with ongoing accretion activity, and smaller groups located in filaments in the regions between the main clusters. Aims. With the goal to investigate the role of cluster mergers and accretion on the radio galaxy population, we performed a multi-wavelength study of the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) and of the galaxies showing extended radio emission in the cluster complexes of Abell 3528 and Abell 3558. In total, our study is based on a sample of 12 galaxies. Methods. We observed the clusters with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) at 235, 325, and 610 MHz, and with the Very Large Array (VLA) at 8.46 GHz. We complemented our study with the TIFR GMRT Sky Survey (TGSS) at 150 MHz, the Sydney University Molonglo Sky Survey (SUMSS) at 843 MHz, and the Australia Telescope Compact array (ATCA) at 1380, 1400, 2380, and 4790 MHz data. Finally, optical imaging with the VLT Survey Telescope (VST) is also available for the host galaxies as well as the mid-infrared coverage with the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). Results. We found significant differences in the properties of the radio emission of the BCGs in the two cluster complexes. The BCGs in the A 3528 complex and in A 3556, which are relaxed cool-core objects, are powerful active radio galaxies. They also present hints of restarted activity. On the contrary, the BCGs in A 3558 and A 3562, which are well-known merging systems, are very faint, or quiet, in the radio band. The optical and infrared properties of the galaxies, on the other hand, are fairly similar in the two complexes, showing all passive red galaxies. Conclusions. Our study shows remarkable differences in the radio properties of the BGCs, which we relate to the different dynamical state of the host cluster. On the contrary, the lack of changes between such different environments in the optical band suggests that the dynamical state of galaxy clusters does not affect the optical counterparts of the radio galaxies, at least over the lifetime of the radio emission. © 2018 ESO.

ABSTRACT: Practice is an essential part of music training, but critical content-based analyses of practice behaviors still lack tools for conveying informative representation of practice sessions. To bridge this gap, we present a novel visualization system, the Music Practice Browser, for representing, identifying, and analysing music practice behaviors. The Music Practice Browser provides a graphical interface for reviewing recorded practice sessions, which allows musicians, teachers, and researchers to examine aspects and features of music practice behaviors. The system takes beat and practice segment information together with a musical score in XML format as input, and produces a number of different visualizations: Practice Session Work Maps give an overview of contiguous practice segments; Practice Segment Arcs make evident transitions and repeated segments; Practice Session Precision Maps facilitate the identifying of errors; Tempo-Loudness Evolution Graphs track expressive variations over the course of a practice session. We then test the new system on practice sessions of pianists of varying levels of expertise ranging from novice to expert. The practice patterns found include Drill-Correct, Drill-Smooth, Memorization Strategy, Review and Explore, and Expressive Evolution. The analysis reveals practice patterns and behavior differences between beginners and experts, such as a higher proportion of Drill-Smooth patterns in expert practice. © 2018 Sokolovskis, Herremans and Chew.

ABSTRACT: We present a numerical analysis of several performances of Zero Waste, a musical piece that results from the interaction of a pianist with a computerized notation and transcription system. Initially, two algorithmically produced measures of music are presented in staff notation for sight-reading. Software then transcribes these measures as played by the performer and displays them again for another round of sight-reading. This iterative process yields complex performances over the piece's duration. Some performances led to a convergence toward somewhat simplified musical patterns, while others exhibited continuous change. Our analysis tracks this evolution through measuring the degree of variation between two consecutive iterations. The resulting graphs present new visualizations that support existing hypotheses about this iterative process of sight-reading and performing and point to new questions regarding automated transcription. © The Author(s) 2018.

ABSTRACT: One of the valuable bioinformatics techniques is protein sequence alignment which is a method of searching, comparing and ordering the sequences of protein. The pointed method is employed to recognize region of similarity which may be a significance of functional, structural, or evolutionary relatives between the protein sequences. In current investigation, an innovative similarity search/alignment algorithm for pattern recognition process of protein structures in the frame of bio-mimicking pattern recognition capabilities of human visual and auditory systems towards investigating more and more novel approaches in the field of protein sequence alignment procedure. The selected approach in current investigation based on the concept of intra scientific facts and using both capabilities of bioinformatics and psychological knowledge led to present the unique automatic translational system (ATS-P) for translating protein structures to musical composition in addition to image color combination towards finalizing innovative pattern and method for protein alignment. Actually during current study, the perception of protein sequence via visual and sonic representation was projected to support researchers in the process of protein pattern recognition and structural demonstrating. In the other word, this presented algorithm confirmed their properties by bio-mimicking of developed visual and auditory perception systems can progress proficient trend to assist protein relevant scientists towards successful protein alignment procedure. © 2018

ABSTRACT: Heavy-ion collisions are well described by a dynamical evolution with a long hydrodynamical phase. In this phase the properties of the strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma are reflected in the equation of state (EoS) and the transport coefficients, most prominently by the shear and bulk viscosity over entropy density ratios η/s(T) and ζ/s(T), respectively. While the EoS is by now known to a high accuracy, the transport coefficients and in particular their temperature and density dependence are not well known from first-principle computations yet, as well as the possible influence they can have once used in hydrodynamical simulations. In this work, the most recent QCD-based parameters are provided as input to the MUSIC framework. A ratio η/s(T) computed with a QCD based approach is used for the first time. The IP-Glasma model is used to describe the initial energy density distribution, and UrQMD for the dilute hadronic phase. Simulations are performed for Pb–Pb collisions at sNN=2.76 TeV, for different centrality intervals. The resulting kinematic distributions of the particles produced in the collisions are compared to data from the LHC, for several experimental observables. The high precision of the experimental results and the broad variety of observables considered allow to critically verify the quality of the description based on first-principle input to the hydrodynamic evolution. © 2018

ABSTRACT: The preferences adopted by individuals are constantly modified as these are driven by new experiences, natural life evolution and, mainly, influence from friends. Studying these temporal dynamics of user preferences has become increasingly important for personalization tasks in information retrieval and recommendation systems domains. However, existing models are too constrained for capturing the complexity of the underlying phenomenon. Online social networks contain rich information about social interactions and relations. Thus, these become an essential source of knowledge for the understanding of user preferences evolution. In this work, we investigate the interplay between user preferences and social networks over time. First, we propose a temporal preference model able to detect preference change events of a given user. Following this, we use temporal networks concepts to analyze the evolution of social relationships and propose strategies to detect changes in the network structure based on node centrality. Finally, we look for a correlation between preference change events and node centrality change events over Twitter and Jam social music datasets. Our findings show that there is a strong correlation between both change events, specially when modeling social interactions by means of a temporal network. © 2018, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The Multiplexed Structured Image Capture (MUSIC) technique is used to demonstrate single-shot multiframe passive imaging, with a nanosecond difference between the resulting images. This technique uses modulation of light from a scene before imaging, in order to encode the target's temporal evolution into spatial frequency shifts, each of which corresponds to a unique time and results in individual and distinct snapshots. The resulting images correspond to different effective imaging gate times, because of the optical path delays. Computer processing of the multiplexed single-shot image recovers the nanosecondresolution evolution. The MUSIC technique is used to demonstrate imaging of a laserinduced plasma. Simultaneous single-shot measurements of electron numbers by coherent microwave scattering were obtained and showed good agreement with MUSIC characterization. The MUSIC technique demonstrates spatial modulation of images used for passive imaging. This allows multiple frames to be stacked into a single image. This method could also pave the way for real-time imaging and characterization of ultrafast processes and visualization, as well as general tracking of fast objects. © 2018 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement.

ABSTRACT: This article outlines the historical evolution and precursors of modern music therapy in Vienna from c. 1820 to 1960. The first section describes early attempts to purposefully integrate music into Viennese psychiatry and highlights the groundbreaking work of Bruno Goergen (1777–1842), who around the year 1820 deliberately incorporated music into psychiatric institutions based on his dedication to the ideals of “moral treatment” and “no-restraint” psychiatry. Shortly thereafter, the first medical dissertations on the therapeutic effect of music began to be published in Vienna. Around 1850, the emergence of an “active” form of “music therapy” (in the broadest sense) is recognizable; during the same time period, physicians began taking their patients’ musical preferences, education, and disposition into account. However, as university medicine became firmly rooted in the standards of experimental science, physicians increasingly lost their interest in music. The second section gives an overview of several cultural movements that emerged in the first half of the twentieth century and inspired the pioneers of music therapy in Vienna, paving the way for the foundation of modern Viennese music therapy in 1958. Among these were the life reform movement, the curative rhythm and dance movement, and anthroposophy, as well as psychotherapy and progressive music-educational concepts. At the conclusion of this article, the main traits of the history of music therapy in Vienna and some of the pervading premises of Viennese music therapy are summarized. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Prior to the 1890s, dance coverage in North-American newspapers was infrequent and haphazard—a sub-species of music criticism or a titbit in the gossip column. Yet beginning in the early 1890s, with the emergence of modern dance on theatrical stages, dance reviewing became a regular feature within American dailies. Modern dance reviews from 1890 to 1920 show heterogeneous stylistic variances that provide retellings and evaluations of dances. Drawing on archival materials, this essay analyses the dance review as it was developing during the fin de siècle, outlining two major developments: first, the evolution of its stylistic expression from the feuilleton style, and second, the rise of its editorial significance within the overall newspaper during this period. Investigating the journalism responding to the work of Loïe Fuller, Isadora Duncan, and Maud Allan, this essay argues that these descriptive and critical writings on dance present nascent reviews, signalling also the development of what we now recognize as the dance review standard, which would become formally established in North-American presses by the 1930s. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Humans devote ample time to produce and perceive music. How and why this behavioral propensity originated in our species is unknown. For centuries, speculation dominated the study of the evolutionary origins of musicality. Following Darwin's early intuitions, recent empirical research is opening a new chapter to tackle this mystery. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Behavioral and brain rhythms in the millisecond-to-second range are central in human music, speech, and movement. A comparative approach can further our understanding of the evolution of rhythm processing by identifying behavioral and neural similarities and differences across cognitive domains and across animal species. We provide an overview of research into rhythm cognition in music, speech, and animal communication. Rhythm has received considerable attention within each individual field, but to date, little integration. This review article on rhythm processing incorporates and extends existing ideas on temporal processing in speech and music and offers suggestions about the neural, biological, and evolutionary bases of human abilities in these domains. © 2018 The Authors

ABSTRACT: This interview sheds light both on a composer and on a hitherto overlooked field, the evolution of electroacoustic music in the former German Democratic Republic (GDR, commonly called East Germany). This latter focus is vital insofar as little of it, if anything at all, is included in established histories of electroacoustic music. These typically take Cologne, Paris, or New York, together with the associated institutions and composers, as starting points, with nary a word for the GDR or elsewhere. The composer Georg Katzer was a key personality in this era. In this conversation he discusses the genesis of electroacoustic music in the GDR, the influences of studios from other countries, the development of the electronic musical instrument known as the Subharchord, establishing a studio (under conditions which, despite adversity, also gave rise to results of a distinctive charm), formal affiliations with international organizations, and much more. © 2018 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

ABSTRACT: Introduction: Music therapy helps to support the well-being of the patient and diverts attention from pain to a very pleasant alternative. Few prospective randomized studies are carried out in emergency departments showing its potential analgesic effect. The aim of the study was to determine the effect of music therapy on morphine consumption in emergencies. Population and methods: A prospective, randomized, monocentric study conducted in emergency departments over a four-month period. We included any patient older than 16 years, consulting trauma emergencies with a numerical scale ≥ 5. Exclusion criteria were absence of consent and anomalies of understanding or communication. After consent, patients were randomized to G. S (morphine) and G. M (Morphine + music therapy). We collected the demographic characteristics, the evolution of the vital parameters and the numerical scale. The primary endpoint was decreased morphine consumption. Secondary endpoints were pain resolution time, side effects and patient satisfaction. Results: We included 144 patients. We recorded reduced morphine consumption in G. M (7.1 ± 2.7 versus 9.6 ± 3 mg with P = 0.022). Time to resolution was faster in G. M (30 ± 13.7 versus 42 ± 16.7 min with P = 0.036). We observed less side effects and more satisfaction in G. M. Conclusion: Music therapy reduces morphine consumption in emergencies and consequently decreases these side effects. This inexpensive therapy increases the patient satisfaction of emergency patients. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS

ABSTRACT: In the age of social networks, and also of an extensive use of Artificial Intelligence, a deeper understanding of the interactions among thousands of individuals should help us in the quest of designing effective procedures to manage the ‘bigdata’ that is overwhelming our human capacity to deal with increasing complexity. This paper offers insights, grounded in the bee colonies natural evolution, to manage this detailed complexity or variety. Variety balances between the nectar foraging and storage operations of the honey bee colony are important for its growth and survival. If there is an optimal variety balance between foragers and storers, their work capacities will be matched and the two operations will function at maximum efficiency. Foragers sense variety imbalances by observing significant deviations from the normal mean levels of the queuing delay experienced when they unload their nectar to the food storers. If there is a short delay, they perform waggle dances to recruit additional foragers but, if there is a long delay, they perform tremble dances to recruit additional storers. These signals reallocate labour to rebalance the system. In addition, algedonic signals are used to recruit or inhibit workers in emergencies. This study shows how a self-organising system can sense and correct variety imbalances without any metasystemic intervention or design. © 2018

ABSTRACT: Evolutionary algorithms have been widely used in the area of creativity in order to help create art and music. We consider the recently introduced evolutionary image composition approach based on feature covariance matrices [1] which allows composing two images into a new one based on their feature characteristics. When using evolutionary image composition it is important to obtain a good weighting of interesting regions of the two images. We use colour-based segmentation based on K-Means clustering to come up with such a weighting of the images. Our results show that this preserves the chosen colour regions of the images and leads to composed images that preserve colours better than the previous approach based on saliency masks [1]. Furthermore, we evaluate our composed images in terms of aesthetic feature and show that our approach based on colour-based segmentation leads to higher feature values for most of the investigated features. © 2018 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: The proposed system aims at automatic identification of an unknown dance posture referring to the 34 primitive postures of ballet, simultaneously measuring the proximity of an unknown dance posture to a known primitive. A simple and novel seven stage algorithm achieves the desired objective. Skin color segmentation is performed on the dance postures, the output of which is dilated and edge is detected. From the boundaries of the postures, connected components are identified and the boundary is piecewise linearly approximated using modified artificial bee colony algorithm. Here, lies the novelty of our work. From the approximated boundary, features are extracted in terms of internal angles. This whole procedure is repeated for all the training images as well as testing image. The classification of the training image containing ballet posture is done using Euclidean distance matching. © 2018 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Sex-specific ornaments typically occur in males, but they can also develop in females. While there are several models concerning the evolution of male-specific ornaments, it is not clear how, or under what circumstances, those models apply to female-specific ornament evolution. Here, we present a manipulative field experiment that explores the theoretical 'trait space' of multiple female-specific ornaments to study howthese unusual traits evolved. We measured the attractiveness of two female-specific ornaments (pinnate leg scales and inflatable abdominal sacs) in the dance fly Rhamphomyia longicauda in a wild mating swarm. We found significant directional preferences for larger ornaments of both types; however, variation in one of the ornaments (abdominal sacs) was almost three times more effective at improving attractiveness. The abdominal ornament was consistently effective in increasing attractiveness to males regardless of leg ornament expression, while leg ornament size was only effective if abdominal ornaments were very small. These results are consistent with predictions from a sexual conflict model of ornament expression in supporting the probable role of deception in the evolution of female-specific ornaments among dance flies. Sexual conflict can be an important force in generating elaborate sex-specific ornaments in females as well as males. © 2018 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: When using BP model to classify speech feature signal, the initial weight and threshold of BP model randomly causes the model to fall into local minimum. A differential evolution algorithm is proposed to optimize the weight and threshold parameters of BP model, then establishing a classification model of speech feature signal based on differential evolution BP neural network algorithm. The classification models are trained and tested using the speech feature signals of four different kinds of music, folk songs, zither, rock and pop music. The test results show that compared with the traditional BP model, the improved BP algorithm model, the speech feature signal classification model based on differential evolution BP neural network is better in operation stability and classification accuracy. © 2018 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Innovation is a fashionable word about which people have different attitudes. Businessmen think it is important for their businesses' development, even if there is no common view of what innovation is or what is meant by it. From an economic point of view, we are going through a period in which emerging economies / industries no longer place a strong emphasis on R & D investment. This is due to the fact that innovation processes have become more and more oriented towards diffusion and absorption of knowledge, therefore these economies / industries are increasingly trying to take advantage of the benefits of adoption and international transfer of technology. The open innovation requires both the use of internal and external intentional knowledge resources to develop a technology that will then open even more the horizons of a market or in other words to accelerate internal innovation and expand markets for external use of innovation. With the adoption of open innovation, the organization's borders become permeable and allow for the combination of company resources and external collaborators. The use of innovation, creativity and human capital represents the keystones for the emergence, development, and evolution of creative industries, which are ever increasing industries, playing a huge role in the economies of many countries, at different levels: local, regional or national level, and covering almost everything from crafts, music, visual arts to design, advertising, publishing and media (thirteen sectors in total, according to DCMS). Based on the literature review, the purpose of this work is to present an intro of the open innovation as a technique or process within the organizational context. The use of this type of technique illustrates the company's capacities to increase their own performance in term of innovation, open access, co-creation, and the use of the crowd as co-designers. The foreseen results are: to understand the emergence of the creative industries within the national and international economy, to highlight the transition process between traditional and creative industries in order to achieve a new innovative path for economic agents, and also to emphasize the power of crowd as an important driver for open innovation implementation. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Dyadic interactions are ubiquitous in our lives, yet they are highly challenging to study. Many subtle aspects of coupled bodily dynamics continuously unfolding during such exchanges have not been empirically parameterized. As such, we have no formal statistical methods to describe the spontaneously self-emerging coordinating synergies within each actor’s body and across the dyad. Such cohesive motion patterns self-emerge and dissolve largely beneath the awareness of the actors and the observers. Consequently, hand coding methods may miss latent aspects of the phenomena. The present paper addresses this gap and provides new methods to quantify the moment-by-moment evolution of self-emerging cohesiveness during highly complex ballet routines. We use weighted directed graphs to represent the dyads as dynamically coupled networks unfolding in real-time, with activities captured by a grid of wearable sensors distributed across the dancers’ bodies. We introduce new visualization tools, signal parameterizations, and a statistical platform that integrates connectivity metrics with stochastic analyses to automatically detect coordination patterns and self-emerging cohesive coupling as they unfold in real-time. Potential applications of these new techniques are discussed in the context of personalized medicine, basic research, and the performing arts. © 2018 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Evolutionary decision fusion has applications in biometric authentication and verification. Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) is one such evolutionary decision fusion approach that can be used to tune the fusion parameters in a multimodal data acquisition system. Human gait is a proven biometric trait with applications in security and authentication. However, acquiring human gait data can be erroneous due to various factors and multimodal fusion of such erroneous gait data can be challenging. In this paper, we propose a new decision fusion-based approach to solve the above problem. Gait data is recorded simultaneously using motion sensors and visible light camera. The signals of the motion sensors are modeled using a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network and corresponding video recordings are processed using a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). GWO has been used to optimize the parameters during fusion. It has been chosen based on the underlying hunting strategy that leads to better approximation of the solution and interestingly, in our case it converges quicker than other optimization techniques such as Genetic Algorithm (GA) or Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). To test the model, a dataset involving 23 males and females have been recorded while they perform four different types of walks including, normal-walk, fast-walk, walking while listening to music, and walking while watching multimedia content on a mobile. An overall accuracy of 91.3% has been recorded across all test scenarios. Results reveal that the proposed study can further be explored to design robust gait biometric systems. IEEE

ABSTRACT: This article contributes to the literature on the association between class position and cultural tastes by analyzing a unique historical data set and asking whether there were significant class differences in the consumption of music in the 19th century. Archival data from a publisher in Milan are used to analyze the characteristics of customers who purchased sheet music between 1814 and 1823. To avoid contemporary depictions of cultural hierarchies (e.g. ‘highbrow’, ‘lowbrow’ and ‘omnivorous’ tastes), we offer a new method for considering both the quantitative and qualitative dimensions of music consumption. Considering both the aggregate level of music consumption and the evolution of individual patterns over time, we find little evidence that musical tastes were aligned with class position. This finding calls for more research on the origins of the strong link between social structure and cultural preferences in general, or between class position and musical tastes in particular, which we witness today. © The Author(s) 2018.

ABSTRACT: The elliptic (v2), triangular (v3), and quadrangular (v4) flow coefficients of π±, K±, p+p¯,Λ+Λ¯,KS0, and the ϕ-meson are measured in Pb-Pb collisions at sNN=5.02 TeV. Results obtained with the scalar product method are reported for the rapidity range |y| &lt; 0.5 as a function of transverse momentum, pT, at different collision centrality intervals between 0–70%, including ultra-central (0–1%) collisions for π±, K±, and p + p ¯. For pT&lt; 3 GeV/c, the flow coefficients exhibit a particle mass dependence. At intermediate transverse momenta (3 &lt; pT &lt; 8–10 GeV/c), particles show an approximate grouping according to their type (i.e., mesons and baryons). The ϕ-meson v2, which tests both particle mass dependence and type scaling, follows p + p ¯ v2 at low pT and π±v2 at intermediate pT. The evolution of the shape of vn(pT) as a function of centrality and harmonic number n is studied for the various particle species. Flow coefficients of π±, K±, and p + p ¯ for pT &lt; 3 GeV/c are compared to iEBE-VISHNU and MUSIC hydrodynamical calculations coupled to a hadronic cascade model (UrQMD). The iEBE-VISHNU calculations describe the results fairly well for pT &lt; 2.5 GeV/c, while MUSIC calculations reproduce the measurements for pT &lt; 1 GeV/c. A comparison to vn coefficients measured in Pb-Pb collisions at sNN=2.76 TeV is also provided.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]. © 2018, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Seeking to identify the common and distinguishing attributes of effects one might call “aesthetic,” I examined hundreds of examples in music, visual arts, poetry, literature, humor, performance arts, architecture, science, mathematics, games, and other disciplines. I observed that all involve quasi-emotional reactions to stimuli that are composites of multiple elements that ordinarily do not occur together and whose interaction, when appropriately potentiated, is transformative—different in kind from the effects of the separate constituent elements. Such effects, termed synergetic, can evoke surprise-tinged emotional responses. Aesthetic reactions, unlike many other kinds of emotional reactions, are never evoked by biologically urgent action-demanding events, such as threats or opportunities. The examined effects were created by various concept manipulation devices: class expansion, identification of new relations, repetition, symmetry, parsimony, and emotional displays for the audience to mirror (I identified a total of 16 such devices). The effects would occur only for individuals with the necessary priming, in circumstances that include effective potentiating factors. Synergetic stimuli that evoke aesthetic responses tend to be reinforcing, via mechanisms related to their biological utility during our evolution. I offer a theory as to how aesthetics may have evolved from its primordial pre-aesthetic roots, with examples of how consideration of those roots often explains aesthetic and related effects. The article suggests that aesthetic phenomena are a special case of a more pervasive aspect of behavior and proposes research approaches involving laboratory models and fMRI technology. © 2017, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Comparison of emotion perception in music and prosody has the potential to contribute to an understanding of their speculated shared evolutionary origin. Previous research suggests shared sensitivity to and processing of music and speech, but less is known about how emotion perception in the auditory domain might be influenced by individual differences. Personality, emotional intelligence, gender, musical training and age exert some influence on discrete, summative judgments of perceived emotion in music and speech stimuli. However, music and speech are temporal phenomena, and little is known about whether individual differences influence moment-by-moment perception of emotion in these domains. A behavioral study collected two main types of data: continuous ratings of perceived emotion while listening to extracts of music and speech, using a computer interface which modeled emotion on two dimensions (arousal and valence), and demographic information including measures of personality (TIPI) and emotional intelligence (TEIQue-SF). Functional analysis of variance on the time series data revealed a small number of statistically significant differences associated with Emotional Stability, Agreeableness, musical training and age. The results indicate that individual differences exert limited influence on continuous judgments of dynamic, naturalistic expressions. We suggest that this reflects a reliance on acoustic cues to emotion in moment-by-moment judgments of perceived emotions and is further evidence of the shared sensitivity to and processing of music and speech. © 2018 Dibben, Coutinho, Vilar and Estévez-Pérez.

ABSTRACT: Insects have acquired excellent sensory information processing abilities in the process of evolution. In addition, insects have developed communication schemes based on the temporal patterns of specific sensory signals. For instance, male moths approach a female by detecting the spatiotemporal pattern of a pheromone plume released by the female. Male crickets attract a conspecific female as a mating partner using calling songs with species-specific temporal patterns. The dance communication of honeybees relies on a unique temporal pattern of vibration caused by wingbeats during the dance. Underlying these behaviors, neural circuits involving inhibitory connections play a critical common role in processing the exact timing of the signals in the primary sensory centers of the brain. Here, we discuss common mechanisms for processing the temporal patterns of sensory signals in the insect brain. © 2018 Ai, Kumaraswamy, Kohashi, Ikeno and Wachtler.

ABSTRACT: Anthropogenic sound is increasingly considered a major environmental issue, but its effects are relatively unstudied. Organisms may be directly affected by anthropogenic sound in many ways, including interference with their ability to detect mates, predators, or food, and disturbances that directly affect one organism may in turn have indirect effects on others. Thus, to fully appreciate the net effect of anthropogenic sound, it may be important to consider both direct and indirect effects. We report here on a series of experiments to test the hypothesis that anthropogenic sound can generate cascading indirect effects within a community. We used a study system of lady beetles, soybean aphids, and soybean plants, which are a useful model for studying the direct and indirect effects of global change on food webs. For sound treatments, we used several types of music, as well as a mix of urban sounds (e.g., sirens, vehicles, and construction equipment), each at volumes comparable to a busy city street or farm tractor. In 18-hr feeding trials, rock music and urban sounds caused lady beetles to consume fewer aphids, but other types of music had no effect even at the same volume. We then tested the effect of rock music on the strength of trophic cascades in a 2-week experiment in plant growth chambers. When exposed to music by AC/DC, who articulated the null hypothesis that “rock and roll ain't noise pollution” in a song of the same name, lady beetles were less effective predators, resulting in higher aphid density and reduced final plant biomass relative to control (no music) treatments. While it is unclear what characteristics of sound generate these effects, our results reject the AC/DC hypothesis and demonstrate that altered interspecific interactions can transmit the indirect effects of anthropogenic noise through a community. © 2018 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: While structured as an autobiography, this memoir exemplifies ways in which classic contributions to cybernetics (e.g., by Wiener, McCulloch & Pitts, and von Neumann) have fed into a diversity of current research areas, including the mathematical theory of systems and computation, artificial intelligence and robotics, computational neuroscience, linguistics, and cognitive science. The challenges of brain theory receive special emphasis. Action-oriented perception and schema theory complement neural network modeling in analyzing cerebral cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, and basal ganglia. Comparative studies of frog, rat, monkey, ape and human not only deepen insights into the human brain but also ground an EvoDevoSocio view of “how the brain got language.” The rapprochement between neuroscience and architecture provides a recent challenge. The essay also assesses some of the social and theological implications of this broad perspective. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Charles Darwin suggested the perception of rhythm to be common to all animals. While only recently experimental research is finding some support for this claim, there are also aspects of rhythm cognition that appear to be species-specific, such as the capability to perceive a regular pulse (or beat) in a varying rhythm. In the current study, using EEG, we adapted an auditory oddball paradigm that allows for disentangling the contributions of beat perception and isochrony to the temporal predictability of the stimulus. We presented two rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) with a rhythmic sequence in two versions: an isochronous version, that was acoustically accented such that it could induce a duple meter (like a march), and a jittered version using the same acoustically accented sequence but that was presented in a randomly timed fashion, as such disabling beat induction. The results reveal that monkeys are sensitive to the isochrony of the stimulus, but not its metrical structure. The MMN was influenced by the isochrony of the stimulus, resulting in a larger MMN in the isochronous as opposed to the jittered condition. However, the MMN for both monkeys showed no interaction between metrical position and isochrony. So, while the monkey brain appears to be sensitive to the isochrony of the stimulus, we find no evidence in support of beat perception. We discuss these results in the context of the gradual audiomotor evolution (GAE) hypothesis (Merchant and Honing, 2014) that suggests beat-based timing to be omnipresent in humans but only weakly so or absent in non-human primates. © 2018 Honing, Bouwer, Prado and Merchant.

ABSTRACT: Motivated by the hypothesis that the spread of viral videos is analogous to the spread of a disease epidemic, we formulate a novel susceptible–exposed–infected–recovered–susceptible (SEIRS) delay differential equation epidemic model to describe the popularity evolution of viral videos. Our models incorporate time-delay, in order to accurately describe the virtual contact process between individuals and the temporary immunity of individuals to videos after they have grown tired of watching them. We validate our models by fitting model parameters to viewing data from YouTube music videos, in order to demonstrate that the model solutions accurately reproduce real behaviour seen in this data. We use an SEIR model to describe the initial growth and decline of daily views, and an SEIRS model to describe the long term behaviour of the popularity of music videos. We also analyse the decay rates in the daily views of videos, determining whether they follow a power law or exponential distribution. Although we focus on viral videos, the modelling approach may be used to understand dynamics emergent from other areas of science which aim to describe consumer behaviour. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: In this paper, a new locating method based on the optimization method for estimating the position of an electric dipole source in underwater environments with a plate uniform circular antenna (PUCA) is presented. The image principle is introduced to build the manifold of the PUCA, greatly reducing the complexity of the manifold. The evaluation function is obtained using the mixed polarization multiple signal classification algorithm, where the minimum value is found using the fast optimal method improved matrix adaptation evolution strategy (MA-ES). In this locating method, the voltage from each channel of the PUCA is the input spatial-temporal data. As a result, the 3-D field components are reduced, and the method can easily be implemented in practical engineering applications. The theoretical analysis and the experiments conducted for both the simulation and the actual received data demonstrate that the accuracy performance of the locating method based on the improved MA-ES is higher than that of the MA-ES and of the covariance MA-ES. © 2013 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: MetaCompose is a music generator based on a hybrid evolutionary technique combining FI-2POP and multi-objective optimization. In this paper we employ the MetaCompose music generator to create music in real-time that expresses different mood-states in a game-playing environment (Checkers) and present preliminary results of an experiment focusing on determining (i) if differences in player experience can be observed when using affective-dynamic music compared to static music; and (ii) if any difference is observed when the music supports the game's internal narrative/state. Participants were tasked to play two games of Checkers while listening to two (out of three) different set-ups of game-related generated music.

ABSTRACT: In this study, a neuroevolution strategy using Multi-Agent Incorporated Hierarchical Ensemble Model (MAIHEM) inspired by human incorporated company structure is proposed. It utilizes the hierarchical structure to ensemble modules of entities into firms to preserve complex structure at lower level, and at higher level incorporates firms into departments to facilitate multiple objectives. The corporate level structure from the top guides and reviews their overall performance. The ensemble structure not only compete within their own ranks, but also cooperate and swap/merger underlying units for fast adaptation without compromising their existing structures. The preliminary result with multi-constrained music melody generation shows this strategy can not only solve complex multi-objective tasks steadily but also preserve diversity in the population. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

ABSTRACT: Although often thought of as a contemporary practice, audience development and pedagogies for listener education can be traced throughout the history of the public concert where their origins were forged. This paper unpacks how western listening and audience practices have developed over time, the changes in listening and behaviour norms, the emergence of early practitioners who developed ideas and pedagogies for listener education within the concert hall in Europe, and exposes the current paucity of research on the educational dimension of audience development and pedagogies of listening in the contemporary orchestral concert hall. It is argued that by understanding the past we can better understand the current concert hall and the ways we ourselves actively participate and create our own histories in the ongoing evolution of classical music performance. The paper concludes that this cultural inheritance has implications for arts organisations, educators, audiences, and listeners alike. © 2017 Stichting Paedagogica Historica.

ABSTRACT: When musicians are asked to create music with a special theme or for a particular use, it is important for them to meet the client's demands and express their original creativity. As this task is a little more difficult than their free creative activities, an automatic music composition system may support them. Requirements for the system are the ease of expressing the musicians' intention and the shortness of the processing time. In this paper, a scene where musicians create a song using an automatic composition system is assumed, and a method of generating a melody for the system is proposed. In the proposed method, two kinds of sensibility models for melody are induced from the existing music. A melody template is generated on the basis of those models using a symbiotic evolution algorithm. A melody is completed by determining pitch of each note in the melody template. The results of the subjective evaluation experiment show the effectiveness of the proposed method. In addition, two case studies of works with professional musicians are also presented. The results of questionnaire surveys show that the composed music reflects the musicians' intentions and is not inferior to music composed by human composers. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

ABSTRACT: This paper presents a harmony search optimization (HSO) based method for solving multi-area economic load dispatch problem with a view of obtaining the global best solution. HSO, mimics the improvisation process of music players, is one of the evolutionary computing models for solving multimodal optimization problems. Each harmony is defined to denote the real power generations of all the generating units and a fitness function representing the problem objective is formulated. A repair mechanism is suggested to handle generation limit and prohibited operating region constraints. The proposed method is tested on a two area economic load dispatch problem and the results are presented. © 2018 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).

ABSTRACT: In this work, the single-mode Richtmyer–Meshkov instability is studied numerically to find a reasonable nonlinear theoretical model which can be applied to predict the interface evolution from the linear stage to the early nonlinear stage. The cut-cell-based sharp-interface methods MuSiC + (Chang et al. in J Comput Phys 242:946–990, 2013) and CCGF (Bai and Deng in Adv Appl Math Mech 9(5):1052–1075, 2017) are applied to generate numerical results for comparisons. Classical Air–SF6 and Air–Helium conditions are applied in this study, and initial amplitude and Atwood number are varied for comparison. Comparisons to the simulation results from the literature show the applicability of MuSiC + and CCGF. Comparisons to the nonlinear theoretical models show that ZS (Zhang and Sohn in Phys Lett A 212:149–155, 1996; Phys Fluids 9:1106–1124, 1997), SEA (Sadot et al. in Phys Rev Lett 80:1654–1657, 1998), and DR (Dimonte and Ramaprabhu in Phys Fluids 22:014104, 2010) models are valid for both spike and bubble growth rates, and MIK (Mikaelian in Phys Rev E 67:026319, 2003) and ZG (Zhang and Guo in J Fluid Mech 786:47–61, 2016) models are valid for bubble growth rate, when the initial perturbation is small and the Atwood number is low, but only the DR model is applicable for both spike and bubble growth rates when the initial perturbation amplitude and the Atwood number are large. A new term of non-dimensional initial perturbation amplitude is presented and multiplied to the DR model to get a unified fitted DR model, which gives consistent results to the simulation ones for small and large initial amplitudes. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

ABSTRACT: The computation of distances between strings has applications in molecular biology, music theory and pattern recognition. One such measure, called short reversal distance, has applications in evolutionary distance computation. It has been shown that this problem can be reduced to the computation of a maximum independent set on the corresponding graph that is constructed from the given input strings. The constructed graphs primarily fall into a class that we call layered graphs. In a layered graph, each layer refers to a subgraph containing, at most, some k vertices. The inter-layer edges are restricted to the vertices in adjacent layers. We study the MIS, MVC, MDS, MCV and MCD problems on layered graphs where MIS computes the maximum independent set; MVC computes the minimum vertex cover; MDS computes the minimum dominating set; MCV computes the minimum connected vertex cover; and MCD computes the minimum connected dominating set. The MIS, MVC and MDS are computed in polynomial time if k = Θ(log V). MCV and MCD are computed polynomial time if k = ((log V)α), where α &lt; 1. If k = Θ((log V)1+e), for ∈ &gt; 0, then MIS, MVC and MDS are computed in quasi-polynomial time. If k = Θ(log V), then MCV and MCD are computed in quasi-polynomial time. © 2018 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Integrated visual displays that combine gesture with colour are nearly ubiquitous in the animal world, where they are shaped by sexual selection for their role in courtship and competition. However, few studies assess how multiple selection regimens operate on different components of these complex phenotypes on a macroevolutionary scale. Here, we study this issue by assessing how both sexual and ecological selection work together to influence visual display complexity in the birds of paradise. We first find that sexual dichromatism is highest in lekking species, which undergo more intense sexual selection by female choice, than non-lekking species. At the same time, species in which males directly compete with one another at communal display courts have more carotenoid-based ornaments and fewer melanin ornaments. Meanwhile, display habitat influences gestural complexity. Species that dance in the cluttered understorey have more complex dances than canopy-displaying species. Taken together, our results illustrate how distinct selection regimens each operate on individual elements comprising a complex display. This supports a modular model of display evolution, wherein the ultimate integrated display is the product of synergy between multiple factors that select for different types of phenotypic complexity. © 2018 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: As one of the most prominent voices of the so-called third generation of Nigerian authors, Chika Unigwe has engaged in the representation of female characters who embody alternative forms of feminism(s) in Nigeria and its diaspora. This article explores Unigwe’s novel Night Dancer (2012) as a distinctive third-generation novel advocating self-emancipation through the appropriation and reversal of patriarchal nationalist discourses which objectify and sexualize female bodies. The evolution of Ezi, Night Dancer’s main character, is examined in relation to Unigwe’s discussion of a lack of solidarity between women and the significance of intergenerational teaching. Against this background, I argue that the novel depicts Unigwe’s rejection of the mind/body dichotomy by relating it to Ezi’s commodification of her body, and to her engagement with and refusal of intergenerational discourses inscribing female bodies within epistemological nationalist discourses. © 2018, The Author(s) 2018.

ABSTRACT: In recent years, the Computational Creativity field has been boosted significantly through researches in human abilities related themes, especially artistic abilities. One of the greatest challenges in working on this field is that the created artifacts are hard to evaluate. In this work is presented a creative music compositor for digital games that explores combinational and explorational creativity. The method is based on Genetic Algorithm and uses the Regent-Dependent Creativity metric to evaluate the generated artifacts. The results demonstrate that some melodies generated by the system are considered creative also by human evaluators. © 2017 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Increasingly both in the theory and practice of organizational development, themes of connecting with the other, participation and co-creation, leveraging "We Spaces" are becoming more common. How then can music bring a positive contribution to transformation within organizations? This chapter discusses the potential role that contemplating self and other through the frame of music can give to the transformation of consciousness. A pioneering approach to personal transformation is introduced in which music amplifies personal narratives in small groups and is the primary lens for self- awareness and mutual discovery. Theorists and practitioners from diverse disciplines inform a theoretical backdrop: from John Dewey (The later works of John Dewey (Volume 10, 1925 - 1953): 1934, Art as experience. Southern Illinois University Press, Carbondale, 1989) and Maxine Greene (Active learning and aesthetic encounters, 1st edn. NCREST, New York, 1995) in aesthetic education; David Cooperrider and Diana Whitney (Collaborating for change: appreciative inquiry. Berrett-Koehler Publishers, Oakland, 1999) - appreciative inquiry; integral organizational development; integral philosophy of Steven McIntosh (Integral consciousness and the future of evolution: how the integral worldview is transforming politics, culture and spirituality. Paragon House, St Paul, 2007) and Ken Wilber (A brief theory of everything. Shambala Press, Boston, 2000), and the African philosophy of Ubuntu Dion Forster (HTS Theol Stud 66(1):1-12, 2010). The integration of diverse perspectives paints a picture of how and why such music-centric approaches hold relevance for personal and group transformation in twentyfirst- century organizations. This chapter is intended to make a small contribution to sparking inquiry and inspiring innovative practices, locally and globally in the evolving field of organizational development.We live during a time when finding viable and engaging approaches to heal and transform the many divides within organizations and societies globally are sorely needed. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

ABSTRACT: Since the evolution of information technology, concerns have been raised to unethical IT conducts and their significant monetary and non-monetary losses for corporations. To date, a number of endeavors have been undertaken to model individuals' IT ethical behaviors. Perceived importance of the ethical issue, ethical judgment, ethical obligation, ego strength, codes of ethics, and law are some of the influencing factors. A relatively new factor, which needs further empirical examinations, is perceived possibility of disclosure, i.e. the possibility one perceives about disclosing either the unethical behavior or its consequences to others. The objective of this research is to practically examine the influence of perceived possibility of disclosure on ethical conducts in an IT context. Accordingly, an interventional research (pre-post study) is designed and data were gathered from 347 computer stations in an IT-centric company in Iran. Due to the company's codes of ethics, six categories of unethical IT-related behaviors were defined as a) surfing social media, b) checking personal emails, c) sending organizational documents without authorized tools, d) sharing video or music files in local network, e) stockbroking, and f) installing non-job-related software on computers. Two non-simultaneous phases with duration of three months were examined. In the first phase, a total number of 906 unethical behaviors were observed by means of company-wide log-systems. Subsequently, for the second phase, every personnel were formally informed that their working behavior with computer stations is systematically monitored. Then, all computer stations were monitored for another three months and 155 unethical behaviors were observed. Results revealed that in comparison with the first phase, by average more than 82% of unethical behaviors were reduced. In addition, the most three reductions in unethical behaviors were stockbroking (95.91%), transmission of organizational data (91.95%), and software installation (89.51%), respectively. Finally, practical solutions to decrease the risk of unethical conducts in the domain of perceived possibility of disclosure in an IT context are discussed. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2018.

ABSTRACT: Deblurring is the process of removing blurring artifacts from signals, such as blur caused by noise, defocus aberration or motion blur. Blind Convolution for signal separation is an area of research in the field of signal processing from last few decades. Similarly, image deblurring and restoration has also been an area of research using different techniques like Blind Signal Separation (BSS), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) combined with DCT, DWT, Differential Evolution Optimization. However, very little research is been done on audio deblurring. In this paper, we proposed an idea for deblurring of an audio signal using SVD. At the end, we also computed root mean square error (RMSE), normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) between the original audio signals and the signals retrieved after applying SVD. © 2017 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Mutations in the transcription factors FOXP1, FOXP2, and FOXP4 affect human cognition, including language. The FoxP gene locus is evolutionarily ancient and highly conserved in its DNA-binding domain. In Drosophila melanogaster FoxP has been implicated in courtship behavior, decision making, and specific types of motor-learning. Because honeybees (Apis mellifera, Am) excel at navigation and symbolic dance communication, they are a particularly suitable insect species to investigate a potential link between neural FoxP expression and cognition. We characterized two AmFoxP isoforms and mapped their expression in the brain during development and in adult foragers. Using a custom-made antiserum and in situ hybridization, we describe 11 AmFoxP expressing neuron populations. FoxP was expressed in equivalent patterns in two other representatives of Apidae; a closely related dwarf bee and a bumblebee species. Neural tracing revealed that the largest FoxP expressing neuron cluster in honeybees projects into a posterior tract that connects the optic lobe to the posterior lateral protocerebrum, predicting a function in visual processing. Our data provide an entry point for future experiments assessing the function of FoxP in eusocial Hymenoptera. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: The shape and design of the modern violin are largely influenced by two makers from Cremona, Italy: The instrument was invented by Andrea Amati and then improved by Antonio Stradivari. Although the construction methods of Amati and Stradivari have been carefully examined, the underlying acoustic qualities which contribute to their popularity are little understood. According to Geminiani, a Baroque violinist, the ideal violin tone should “rival the most perfect human voice.” To investigate whether Amati and Stradivari violins produce voice-like features, we recorded the scales of 15 antique Italian violins as well as male and female singers. The frequency response curves are similar between the Andrea Amati violin and human singers, up to ∼4.2 kHz. By linear predictive coding analyses, the first two formants of the Amati exhibit vowel-like qualities (F1/F2 = 503/1,583 Hz), mapping to the central region on the vowel diagram. Its third and fourth formants (F3/F4 = 2,602/3,731 Hz) resemble those produced by male singers. Using F1 to F4 values to estimate the corresponding vocal tract length, we observed that antique Italian violins generally resemble basses/baritones, but Stradivari violins are closer to tenors/altos. Furthermore, the vowel qualities of Stradivari violins show reduced backness and height. The unique formant properties displayed by Stradivari violins may represent the acoustic correlate of their distinctive brilliance perceived by musicians. Our data demonstrate that the pioneering designs of Cremonese violins exhibit voice-like qualities in their acoustic output. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences. All Rights Reserved.

ABSTRACT: Historically, Ladakh in the Western Himalayas was a significant nexus of Trans-Himalayan caravan trade, and thus exhibited a significant hybridity in its material, linguistic, religious, and musical culture. In this paper, I examine the rise of Ladakhi popular music in and through these crossroads, paying attention to themes of hybridity. I look at the development of Ladakhi ethnic, political, and musical identity, and the role of government, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and individuals with regard to the rise of new musical genres. Accompanying the historical survey of the music is as discussion of the evolutions of textual content. Changes in mass media technology and economics have had a profound effect on this remote region, and have shaped how cultural identity is negotiated by both song writers and consumers of popular music. © 2018 Macalester College.

ABSTRACT: Music recommender systems (MRSs) have experienced a boom in recent years, thanks to the emergence and success of online streaming services, which nowadays make available almost all music in the world at the user’s fingertip. While today’s MRSs considerably help users to find interesting music in these huge catalogs, MRS research is still facing substantial challenges. In particular when it comes to build, incorporate, and evaluate recommendation strategies that integrate information beyond simple user–item interactions or content-based descriptors, but dig deep into the very essence of listener needs, preferences, and intentions, MRS research becomes a big endeavor and related publications quite sparse. The purpose of this trends and survey article is twofold. We first identify and shed light on what we believe are the most pressing challenges MRS research is facing, from both academic and industry perspectives. We review the state of the art toward solving these challenges and discuss its limitations. Second, we detail possible future directions and visions we contemplate for the further evolution of the field. The article should therefore serve two purposes: giving the interested reader an overview of current challenges in MRS research and providing guidance for young researchers by identifying interesting, yet under-researched, directions in the field. © 2018, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: We use one-dimensional coupled map lattices (CMLs) to generate sounds that reflect their spatial organization and temporal evolution from a random initial configuration corresponding to uncorrelated noise. In many instances, the process approaches an equilibrium, which generates a sustained tone. The pitch of this tone is proportional to the lattice size, so the CML behaves like an instrument that could be tuned. Among exceptional cases, we provide an example with a metastable strange attractor, which produces an evolving sound reminiscent of drone music. © 2018 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

ABSTRACT: This paper analyses the paradigms of interpretation and the evolution of the creative processes in music and law. Whether it is matter of a score or a law, the text is reborn through the work of the interpreter who, in dealing with the epistemological problem of the understanding, has to harmonize the purity of the philological reconstruction of the object with the need to actualize its sense. Moving from the creative character of every interpretation—neither the musician can be reduced to a mere executor of a concatenation of musical symbols on the staff as Stravinsky wanted nor the judge may be conceived as a bouche de la loi according to Montesquieu’s theory—this work, after having discussed Gadamer and Betti’s hermeneutical approaches to music and law, focuses on the issue of the limits to the interpreters’ freedom. The interpretation here proposed revolves around improvisation, seen as a typical cultural practice of the aesthetic dimension of music. Improvisation, which from baroque to jazz does not correspond to the realm of absolute freedom, is used as a trait d’union in order to make a comparison with legal experience. This is particularly true with the development of case law, which becomes increasingly problematic especially in the light of “liquid modernity”, where the “polytheism of values” has been gaining strength. Seen from this perspective, the comparison between the judge and the musician in their activity as interpreters of a formalized system of signs highlights the controversial relationship between form and creativity, the accuracy of the text and the requisites deriving from the social context, certainty and justice. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: The maximum clique problem (MCP) is to determine a complete subgraph (clique) of maximum cardinality in a given graph. MCP is conspicuous for having real world applications and for its potentiality of modeling other combinatorial problems and is one of the most studied NP-hard problems. This paper investigates the capabilities of Harmony Search (HS) algorithm, a music inspired meta heuristic for solving maximum clique problem. We propose and compare two different instantiations of a generic HS algorithm namely Harmony Search for MCP (HS_MCP) and Harmony Search with idiosyncratic harmonies for MCP (HSI_MCP) for this problem. HS_MCP has better exploitation and inferior exploration capabilities than HSI_MCP whereas HSI_MCP has better exploration and inferior exploitation capabilities than HSI_MCP, it has been concluded that former performs better than latter by testing them on all the instances of DIMACS benchmark graphs. HS_MCP has been compared with a recently proposed Harmony search based algorithm for MCP called Binary Harmony search (BHS) and the simulation results show that HS_MCP significantly outperforms BHS in terms of solution quality. The asymptotic time complexity of HS_MCP is O(G× N3) where G is the number of generations and N is the number of nodes in the graph. A glimpse of effectiveness of some state-of-the-art exact algorithms on MCP has also been provided. © 2017, Operational Research Society of India.

ABSTRACT: Since the advent of blogging, microblogging, and social networking sites, researchers and practitioners have been increasingly concerned with the problem of obtaining useful evaluations from web-based opinion articles in a process known as opinion mining or sentiment analysis. In this study, we focused on reviews based on highly emotion-embedded products/services, such as movies, music, and drama. Furthermore, we tried to solve the multiple polarities problem for the same review word for multiple types of product/service. First, we collected text written in Chinese from a Taiwanese movie forum. In our proposed approach, we applied an evolutionary strategy algorithm to optimize the weight tables corresponding to two different types of movies: horror and drama movies. The experimental results indicated that the proposed method performed better than conventional methods when considering only one generalized type. Further, we employed a new multi-class support vector machine approach for predicting opinions at the document level. We used seven measures to describe the characteristics of an overall document, including the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the predicted sentence value distribution, where the fluctuations in these values corresponded to their positions in the document. We also demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach for identifying opinions at the document level. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: This research uses an MR-Compatible cello to compare functional brain activation during singing and cello playing within the same individuals to determine the extent to which arbitrary auditory-motor associations, like those required to play the cello, co-opt functional brain networks that evolved for singing. Musical instrument playing and singing both require highly specific associations between sounds and movements. Because these are both used to produce musical sounds, it is often assumed in the literature that their neural underpinnings are highly similar. However, singing is an evolutionarily old human trait, and the auditory-motor associations used for singing are also used for speech and non-speech vocalizations. This sets it apart from the arbitrary auditory-motor associations required to play musical instruments. The pitch range of the cello is similar to that of the human voice, but cello playing is completely independent of the vocal apparatus, and can therefore be used to dissociate the auditory-vocal network from that of the auditory-motor network. While in the MR-Scanner, 11 expert cellists listened to and subsequently produced individual tones either by singing or cello playing. All participants were able to sing and play the target tones in tune (< 50C deviation from target). We found that brain activity during cello playing directly overlaps with brain activity during singing in many areas within the auditory-vocal network. These include primary motor, dorsal pre-motor, and supplementary motor cortices (M1, dPMC, SMA),the primary and periprimary auditory cortices within the superior temporal gyrus (STG) including Heschl's gyrus, anterior insula (aINS), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and intraparietal sulcus (IPS), and Cerebellum but, notably, exclude the periaqueductal gray (PAG) and basal ganglia (Putamen). Second, we found that activity within the overlapping areas is positively correlated with, and therefore likely contributing to, both singing and playing in tune determined with performance measures. Third, we found that activity in auditory areas is functionally connected with activity in dorsal motor and pre-motor areas, and that the connectivity between them is positively correlated with good performance on this task. This functional connectivity suggests that the brain areas are working together to contribute to task performance and not just coincidently active. Last, our findings showed that cello playing may directly co-opt vocal areas (including larynx area of motor cortex), especially if musical training begins before age 7. © 2018 Segado, Hollinger, Thibodeau, Penhune and Zatorre.

ABSTRACT: The stories of both disco and house music are often marginalized in the broader narrative of popular music, but house music’s stylistic features are reflective of wider sociocultural developments. Taking its cue from disco, house is often seen as a purely evolutionary musical development, when in fact the seeds of house music were sown with the Civil Rights Movement, Stonewall, and gay liberation. This article asserts that disco’s use of gospel elements created a quasi-religious proto-PLUR (Peace, Love, Unity, Respect) ideology on the dance floors of the 1970s, and that this was an expression of those made Other by aspects of either race or sexuality. This expression of Otherness became the founding principle underpinning house music’s form. This article critically reappraises the narratives of both disco and house and interrogates inconsistencies in popular historical accounts using new qualitative interviews with authoritative individuals (DJs, producers, vocalists, authors). Furthermore, the article offers a thematic analysis of house music’s stylistic tropes, drawing direct parallels to Christianity and disco’s gospel influences to create a secularized religious ideology comparable to a PLUR ideology. Finally, the article explores the church’s response to racially motivated economic sanctions as a potential trigger to the generation of house music. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: In the city of Barranquilla, Colombia, carnival is a main source of identity. Since the 2003 UNESCO proclamation of this carnival as an Intangible Cultural Heritage, the celebration has gained national and international attention, while the city has developed a whole cultural market around it. This essay traces the evolution of a popular costume and street performance that carries racial stereotypes and as such, has become almost emblematic of carnival time itself. La Negrita Puloy de Montecristo is now the only female symbol of the Barranquilla Carnival. It is argued in this essay that as long as blackness is performed during the regulated time of carnival, lived by the city as an illusion of racial integration and black pride, the consciousness of inequality stays dormant and inequality continues being a quotidian practice in a supposedly tri-racial nation that was funded on the principles of mixture. This essay is the product of a research project that lasted a year and combined ethnographic and archival work. Las Negritas Puloy de Montecristo perform exclusion annually, as they intend to paradoxically perform inclusion. This very popular carnival manifestation seems to be a sign that only as stereotype can the sexualized black woman participate in the public sphere. As the mulata, she is a sexual object. As a slave, she is forgotten. Thus, she can dance. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group

ABSTRACT: Over tens of thousands of years of human genetic and cultural evolution, many types and varieties of music and language have emerged; however, the fundamental components of each of these modes of communication seem to be common to all human cultures and social groups. In this brief review, rather than focusing on the development of different musical techniques and practices over time, the main issues addressed here concern: (i) when, and speculations as to why, modern Homo sapiens evolved musical behaviors, (ii) the evolutionary relationship between music and language, and (iii) why humans, perhaps unique among all living species, universally continue to possess two complementary but distinct communication streams. Did music exist before language, or vice versa, or was there a common precursor that in some way separated into two distinct yet still overlapping systems when cognitively modern H. sapiens evolved? A number of theories put forward to explain the origin and persistent universality of music are considered, but emphasis is given, supported by recent neuroimaging, physiological, and psychological findings, to the role that music can play in promoting trust, altruistic behavior, social bonding, and cooperation within groups of culturally compatible but not necessarily genetically related humans. It is argued that, early in our history, the unique socializing and harmonizing power of music acted as an essential counterweight to the new and evolving sense of self, to an emerging sense of individuality and mortality that was linked to the development of an advanced cognitive capacity and articulate language capability. © 2018 Harvey.

ABSTRACT: We analyse more than 500 000 songs released in the UK between 1985 and 2015 to understand the dynamics of success (defined as ‘making it’ into the top charts), correlate success with acoustic features and explore the predictability of success. Several multi-decadal trends have been uncovered. For example, there is a clear downward trend in ‘happiness’ and ‘brightness’, as well as a slight upward trend in ‘sadness’. Furthermore, songs are becoming less ‘male’. Interestingly, successful songs exhibit their own distinct dynamics. In particular, they tend to be ‘happier’, more ‘party-like’, less ‘relaxed’ and more ‘female’ than most. The difference between successful and average songs is not straightforward. In the context of some features, successful songs pre-empt the dynamics of all songs, and in others they tend to reflect the past. We used random forests to predict the success of songs, first based on their acoustic features, and then adding the ‘superstar’ variable (informing us whether the song’s artist had appeared in the top charts in the near past). This allowed quantification of the contribution of purely musical characteristics in the songs’ success, and suggested the time scale of fashion dynamics in popular music. © 2018 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Purpose: What effects does radical innovation produce on the dialectical relationship between enterprises and their environment? In this paper, by adopting the dynamic adaptation matrix methodological framework, the author addresses this research question by discussing the evolution of the music industry in the period of 1999-2013. The purpose of this study is to identify possible co-evolutionary adaptation paths, namely, virtuous or contradictory adaptation cycles. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is presented as a descriptive comparative case study about the major changes that have occurred in the sector, and this could be of interest to the industry stakeholders. The paper also contributes to the debate about co-evolution as it is an empirical implementation of the adaptation matrix and sheds light on the main environmental dynamics. Findings: The author found that for a low level of environmental determinism and moderate degree of strategic choice, cost leadership strategy dominates other strategic options. For moderate levels of environmental determinism, differentiation-marketing strategy ensures a better performance than differentiation-innovation strategy. Finally, for a high level of both environmental determinism and strategic choice, differentiation-innovation strategy is the best strategic option among differentiation strategies. Practical implications: The adaptation matrix, especially in its dynamic form, can be applied to understand the changes within a sector with a co-evolutionary lens and to analyze critically the strategic choices enacted by the market’s incumbents. Originality/value: This study may have useful implications for both scientific research and managerial practice. In fact, it is intended for all scholars and practitioners interested in exploring the nature of organizational adaptation, especially in industries affected by major technological changes, such as the music industry, which only recently has been considered as a fertile ground for research. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: Music is a component of human culture of a historically universal presence. Enjoyed by many and irrelevant to few, music continuously receives interest from academia and the public alike. Capable of uniting, as well as dividing, music is often in a focus of individual comparisons. In this study, we combine the approaches of evolutionary and social psychology to investigate the relationship between intelligence, music preferences, and uses of music. We collected data from 467 high school students. We used the Nonverbal Sequence Test, the Uses of Music Questionnaire, and the Scale of Music Preferences. Confirming our expectations based on the Savanna-IQ interaction hypothesis, we found intelligence to be a significant predictor of the preference for instrumental music, but not of the preference for vocal-instrumental music. Furthermore, we revealed the significant role of cognitive use of music as a predictor of the preference for instrumental music. We conducted factor analysis of the Scale of Music Preferences, and revealed five factors: reflective, popular, conservative, intense, and sophisticated. We also found the cognitive use of music to be significantly correlated with the preference for instrumental music, as well as music of reflexive, intense and sophisticated factors. Taken together, our findings support the Savanna-IQ interaction hypothesis. © 2018 American Psychological Association.

ABSTRACT: The brain is an immunologically active organ where neurons and glia cells orchestrate complex innate immune responses against infections and injuries. Neuronal responses involve Toll-like or Nod-like receptors and the secretion of antimicrobial peptides and cytokines. The endosymbiotic theory for the evolutionary origin of mitochondria from primitive bacteria, suggests that they may have also retained the capacity to activate neuronal innate immunity. In fact, it was shown that mitochondrial damage-associated molecular patterns could signal and activate innate immunity and inflammation. Moreover, the mitochondrial cascade hypothesis for sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD) argues that altered mitochondrial metabolism and function can drive neurodegeneration. Additionally, a neuroinflammatory signature with increased levels of pro-inflammatory mediators in PD affected brain areas was recently detected. Herein, we propose that a cascade of events initiating in a dysbiotic gut microbiome drive the production of toxins or antibiotics that target and damage mitochondria. This in turn activates neuronal innate immunity and triggers sterile inflammation phenomena that culminate in the neurodegenerative processes observed in the enteric and in the central nervous systems and that ultimately lead to Parkinson's disease. © 2018 Cardoso and Empadinhas.

ABSTRACT: Color patterns, such as bars or dots that cover the body surface of animals are generally thought to play roles in signaling and camouflage. In birds, however, the macroscopic aspects of plumage coloration are less well understood, as past studies typically described plumage colorations by using spectrophotometric analyses. To provide insight into the evolution of plumage patterns as sexual signals, we characterized interspecific and intersexual variations in the plumage patterns of estrildid finches and tested their associations with other courtship signals and life-history traits using a comparative phylogenetic approach. Our results support the idea that plumage patterns in estrildids are favored by sexual selection because large-sized conspicuous plumage patterns are possessed by species with an elaborate courtship dance. These plumage patterns may also play roles in social signaling because patterns are more conspicuous in species with intraspecific brood parasitism. We predict that pattern traits can be favored by mate choice or intrasexual competition when they can serve as honest indicators of individual condition. As our results are consistent between the sexes, we suggest that the same selective force is acting on the evolution of plumage patterns in males and females in parallel. Finally, we also found a trade-off between large size and vivid color patterns, suggesting that too conspicuous patterns are costly, presumably because of the risk of catching the eyes of potential predators. Therefore, plumage patterns are also shaped by natural selection. © The Author(s) 2017.

ABSTRACT: Music is a peculiar human behavior, yet we still know little as to why and how music emerged. For centuries, the study of music has been the sole prerogative of the humanities. Lately, however, music is being increasingly investigated by psychologists, neuroscientists, biologists, and computer scientists. One approach to studying the origins of music is to empirically test hypotheses about the mechanisms behind this structured behavior. Recent lab experiments show how musical rhythm and melody can emerge via the process of cultural transmission. In particular, Lumaca and Baggio (2017) tested the emergence of a sound system at the boundary between music and language. In this study, participants were given random pairs of signal-meanings; when participants negotiated their meaning and played a "game of telephone" with them, these pairs became more structured and systematic. Over time, the small biases introduced in each artificial transmission step accumulated, displaying quantitative trends, including the emergence, over the course of artificial human generations, of features resembling properties of language and music. In this Note, we highlight the importance of Lumaca and Baggio's experiment, place it in the broader literature on the evolution of language and music, and suggest refinements for future experiments. We conclude that, while psychological evidence for the emergence of proto-musical features is accumulating, complementary work is needed: Mathematical modeling and computer simulations should be used to test the internal consistency of experimentally generated hypotheses and to make new predictions. © 2018 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

ABSTRACT: Current research has noted that auditory stimuli via rhythmic cues can enhance speech in patients with basal ganglia lesions. The contribution of basal ganglia function in music perception and performance is a matter of discussion. The French composer Maurice Ravel suffered from a progressive degenerative cerebral disease of uncertain etiology, probably primary progressive aphasia. Based on the case of the famous composer, we present the hypothesis that the fact he adopted different uses of timbre could be attributed to the altered basal ganglia function during the disease evolution. Our assumption would like to add a point of view to the current diagnostic debate. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.

ABSTRACT: In their commentary on our work, Ravignani and Verhoef (2018) raise concerns about two methodological aspects of our experimental paradigm (the signaling game): (1) the use of melodic signals of fixed length and duration, and (2) the fact that signals are endowed with meaning. They argue that music is hardly a semantic system and that our methodological choices may limit the capacity of our paradigm to shed light on the emergence and evolution of a number of putative musical universals. We reply that musical systems are semantic systems and that the aim of our research is not to study musical universals as such, but to compare more closely the kinds of principles that organize meaning and structure in linguistic and musical systems. © 2018 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

ABSTRACT: The work presented in this paper focuses on the use of acoustic systems for passive acoustic monitoring of ocean vitality for fish populations. Specifically, it focuses on the use of acoustic systems for passive acoustic monitoring of ocean vitality for fish populations. To this end, various indicators can be used to monitor marine areas such as both the geographical and temporal evolution of fish populations. A discriminative model is built using supervised machine learning (random-forest and support-vector machines). Each acquisition is represented in a feature space, in which the patterns belonging to different semantic classes are as separable as possible. The set of features proposed for describing the acquisitions come from an extensive state of the art in various domains in which classification of acoustic signals is performed, including speech, music, and environmental acoustics. Furthermore, this study proposes to extract features from three representations of the data (time, frequency, and cepstral domains). The proposed classification scheme is tested on real fish sounds recorded on several areas, and achieves 96.9% correct classification compared to 72.5% when using reference state of the art features as descriptors. The classification scheme is also validated on continuous underwater recordings, thereby illustrating that it can be used to both detect and classify fish sounds in operational scenarios. © 2018 Acoustical Society of America.

ABSTRACT: Manfred Eigen turned 90 on May 9th, 2017. He celebrated with a small group of colleagues and friends on behalf of the many inspired by him over his lifetime—whether scientists, artists, or philosophers. A small group of friends, because many—who by their breakthroughs have changed the face of science in different research areas—have already died. But it was a special day, devoted to the many genius facets of Manfred Eigen’s oeuvre, and a day to highlight the way in which he continues to exude a great, vital and unbroken passion for science as well as an insatiable curiosity beyond his own scientific interests. He continues to dismiss arguments such as, that scientific problems cannot be solved because of a current lack of appropriate tools, or because of the persuasion of the community that certain things are immeasurable. He has lived up to and accepted only the highest scientific standards with his fundamental contributions in widely differing research fields, for which he has received numerous prizes and honorary doctorates, including the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1967. Some of his outstanding contributions to science and technology are honored in the following chapters. Here, we will report some characteristic traits of Manfred Eigen, and his personal development. We highlight his visionary foresight regarding how multidisciplinary science should combine to study the complex processes of life and its evolution in establishing an institute that applied biological, chemical, and physical methods, and how his vision became sustained reality. © 2017, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: A model of five major chronological phases is suggested for the history of human dance. These phases did not replace one another, but accumulated as successive layers. The earliest phase is associated with courtship, thus explaining the potent role of dance in sexual desire and seduction. The second phase is associated with the appearance of modern human behaviour and the earliest burials, which were rites of passage that involved the first communal dances. The third phase is associated with the appearance of hybrid human-animal figurines that point to altered states of consciousness and aspirations to change reality; this is when trance dance, shamanism, magic and religion came in. The fourth phase is connected with the beginning of agriculture in Neolithic villages, which was coordinated by elaborate calendrical ceremonies. The fifth and final phase is associated with urban societies, economic complexity and specialization; well-trained professional dancers now performed acrobatic body movements and elaborate choreography for the enjoyment of others. The history of dance thus reflects the history of human rituals and religion. © 2017 McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research.

ABSTRACT: We present the first self-consistent prediction for the distribution of formation time-scales for close supermassive black hole (SMBH) pairs following galaxy mergers. Using ROMULUS25, the first large-scale cosmological simulation to accurately track the orbital evolution of SMBHs within their host galaxies down to sub-kpc scales, we predict an average formation rate density of close SMBH pairs of 0.013 cMpc-3 Gyr-1. We find that it is relatively rare for galaxy mergers to result in the formation of close SMBH pairs with sub-kpc separation and those that do form are often the result of Gyr of orbital evolution following the galaxy merger. The likelihood and time-scale to form a close SMBH pair depends strongly on the mass ratio of the merging galaxies, as well as the presence of dense stellar cores. Low stellar mass ratio mergers with galaxies that lack a dense stellar core are more likely to become tidally disrupted and deposit their SMBH at large radii without any stellar core to aid in their orbital decay, resulting in a population of long-lived 'wandering' SMBHs. Conversely, SMBHs in galaxies that remain embedded within a stellar core form close pairs in much shorter time-scales on average. This time-scale is a crucial, though often ignored or very simplified, ingredient to models predicting SMBH mergers rates and the connection between SMBH and star formation activity. © 2018 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: In recent years, Japan's cuisine, or washoku, has been eclipsing that of France as the world's most desirable food. UNESCO recognized washoku as an intangible cultural treasure in 2013, and Tokyo boasts more Michelin-starred restaurants than Paris and New York combined. Together with anime, pop music, fashion, and cute goods, cuisine is part of the "Cool Japan" brand that promotes the country as a new kind of cultural superpower. This book offers insights into many different aspects of Japanese culinary history and practice, from the evolution and characteristics of particular foodstuffs, to their representation in literature and film, to the role of foods in individual, regional, and national identity. It features contributions by both noted Japan specialists and experts in food history. The book poses the question, "What is washoku?" What culinary values are imposed or implied by this term? Which elements of Japanese cuisine are most visible in the global gourmet landscape and why? Chapters from a variety of disciplinary perspectives interrogate how foodways have come to represent aspects of a "unique" Japanese identity and are infused with official and unofficial ideologies. They reveal how Japanese culinary values and choices, past and present, reflect beliefs about gender, class, and race; how they are represented in mass media; and how they are interpreted by state and nonstate actors, at home and abroad. Chapters examine the thoughts, actions, and motives of those who produce, consume, promote, and represent Japanese foods. © Oxford University Press 2018. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: In recent years, there has been renewed interest in the biological and cultural evolution of music, and specifically in the role played by perceptual and cognitive factors in shaping core features of musical systems, such as melody, harmony, and rhythm. One proposal originates in the language sciences. It holds that aspects of musical systems evolve by adapting gradually, in the course of successive generations, to the structural and functional characteristics of the sensory and memory systems of learners and "users" of music. This hypothesis has found initial support in laboratory experiments on music transmission. In this article, we first review some of the most important theoretical and empirical contributions to the field of music evolution. Next, we identify a major current limitation of these studies, i.e., the lack of direct neural support for the hypothesis of cognitive adaptation. Finally, we discuss a recent experiment in which this issue was addressed by using event-related potentials (ERPs). We suggest that the introduction of neurophysiology in cultural transmission research may provide novel insights on the micro-evolutionary origins of forms of variation observed in cultural systems. © 2018 Lumaca, Ravignani and Baggio.

ABSTRACT: Interpersonal communication on online social networks has a significant impact on the society by not only diffusing information, but also forming social ties, norms, and behaviors. Knowing how the conversational discourse semantically and geographically vary over time can help uncover the changing dynamics of interpersonal ties and the digital traces of social events. This article introduces a framework for modeling and visualizing the semantic and spatio-temporal evolution of topics in a spatially embedded and time-stamped interpersonal communication network. The framework consists of (1) a topic modeling workflow for modeling topics and extracting the evolution of conversational discourse; (2) a geo-social network modeling and smoothing approach to projecting connection characteristics and semantics of communication onto geographic space and time; (3) a web-based geovisual analytics environment for exploring semantic and spatio-temporal evolution of topics in a spatially embedded and time-stamped interpersonal communication network. To demonstrate, geo-located and reciprocal user mention and reply tweets over the course of the 2016 primary and presidential elections in the United States from 1 August 2015 to 15 November 2016 were analyzed. The large portion of the topics extracted from mention tweets were related to daily life routines, human activities, and interests such as school, work, sports, dating, wearing, birthday celebration, music, food, and live-tweeting. Specific focus on the analysis of political conversations revealed that the content of conversational discourse was split between civil rights and election-related discussions of the political campaigns and candidates. These political topics exhibited major shifts in terms of content and the popularity in reaction to primaries, debates, and events throughout the study period. While civil rights discussions were more dominant and in higher intensity across the nation and throughout the whole time period, election-specific conversations resulted in temporally varying local hotspots that correlated with locations of primaries and events. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group

ABSTRACT: Purpose: This paper aims to discuss the questioning around the current suitability of ownership both for accessing to certain property (housing, to be more specific) and chattels (digital contents, animals and autonomous robots) that have recently flourished, favored by technological advances and the change in the values of the millennials’ in a context of crisis. Design/methodology/approach: The process of substitution (e.g. through alternative housing tenures, such as intermediate tenures and collaborative housing, licensing digital contents) or erosion/elimination (e.g. owning animals and robots, tokenization through blockchain) of ownership through key types of property and chattels. Findings: Ownership, both of land and goods, is again at the stake. Technological advances and/or new values of millennials in a context of crisis have led to questioning the suitability of ownership to favor universal access to housing, of holding music and other digital contents, have limited the faculties of animals’ and pets’ owners and are favoring the evolution of autonomous robots into subjects of law rather than mere objects. Research limitations/implications: Only key property (housing) and chattels are studied (digital contents, animals, robots). There is no broad study of the global current situation of ownership. Practical implications: It is discussed how the changes of values and technological advances in a context of crisis have impacted in the strength and reliability of ownership to allow access to property and chattels. Social implications: These changes in ownership change how we can access to property (housing) and to chattels (digital media) and even to changes in what is considered “object” such as what is happening in Europe with animals and robots. Originality/value: This is a new approach to consequences of the crisis in the field of housing (fractioning of ownership -temporal and shared ownership-, collaborative economy) and a change of values in the new millennial generation (animals) in this context and owing to the advance of the new technologies (robots).

ABSTRACT: While the "units, events and dynamics" of memetic evolution have been abstractly theorized (Lynch, 1998), they have not been applied systematically to real corpora in music. Some researchers, convinced of the validity of cultural evolution in more than the metaphorical sense adopted by much musicology, but perhaps skeptical of some or all of the claims of memetics, have attempted statistically based corpus-analysis techniques of music drawn from molecular biology, and these have offered strong evidence in favor of system-level change over time (Savage, 2017). This article argues that such statistical approaches, while illuminating, ignore the psychological realities of music-information grouping, the transmission of such groups with varying degrees of fidelity, their selection according to relative perceptual-cognitive salience, and the power of this Darwinian process to drive the systemic changes (such as the development over time of systems of tonal organization in music) that statistical methodologies measure. It asserts that a synthesis between such statistical approaches to the study of music-cultural change and the theory of memetics as applied to music (Jan, 2007), in particular the latter's perceptual-cognitive elements, would harness the strengths of each approach and deepen understanding of cultural evolution in music. © 2018 Jan.

ABSTRACT: Linda Buckley is one of the leading figures in the thriving Irish new music scene, a composer whose work draws together many different elements, from spectralism, to ambient electronica, to minimalism and Irish traditional music. This article uses five works created in the last decade as lenses through which to examine a creative practice in which these apparently disparate elements have become increasingly integrated. From the 2008 string trio, Fiol, to the orchestral work Chiyo (2011), to Torann for large ensemble and electronics (2015), and finally to two works with string quartet, ó ióchtar mara (2015) and Haza (2016), these works represent stages within the evolution of a highly distinctive musical language. © 2018 Cambridge University Press.

ABSTRACT: This article deals with one of the most original and innovative musical expressions of the new century: the so-called «digital cumbia». It is a new music label used in recent times as a way to describe a postmodern and digitally constructed form of cumbia, which is being performed by a new generation of Argentinian musicians who have grown up in the Internet era. The article traces the history of this particular type of cumbia, paying particular attention to the role of digital technology in the development and evolution of this musical scene. © Ediciones Universidad de Salamanca/CC BY-NC-ND.

ABSTRACT: This article aims to compose music melody suited for multiple users’ feelings by employing parallel Distributed Interactive Genetic Algorithm (DIGA). In the DIGA, each user proceeds into a general Interactive Genetic Algorithm (IGA) process by evaluating solution candidates subjectively. In some generations, individuals in IGA are exchanged between the users. With the exchange, each of the users is affected by other users’ feelings. As a result, obtaining good solutions suited for all users is expected. The authors conducted listening experiments for investigating the efficiency of the DIGA for composition of a music melody. Two experimental conditions with and without the exchange were employed. Ten people participated in the experiment as subjects, and were paired for the IGA task. The experimental results showed that a higher fitness was obtained in the final generation and similar melodies were obtained with the exchange. Copyright © 2018, IGI Global.

ABSTRACT: Participation in organized activities has been largely regarded as beneficial for academic and socioemotional development for adolescents, but the impacts of various types of organized activities for adolescents at risk for maltreatment have been rarely tested. In this study, we investigated the differential impacts of five types of maltreatment exposure (physical maltreatment, sexual maltreatment, neglect, other type, and multiple types) on the associations between four types of organized activities (mentored groups, art and music clubs, sport clubs, and academic clubs) and academic and socioemotional development (school engagement, delinquency, depressive symptoms, and trauma symptoms) of adolescents who were investigated by Child Protective Services (CPS) for maltreatment exposure. Data came from a national, longitudinal sample of 790 adolescents in contact with CPS in the U.S. After controlling for demographic characteristics of participants and prior levels of each outcome, multiple linear regression models were fitted to the data with interactions between the organized activities and the maltreatment types. The main findings of this study included: 1) adolescents who participated in mentored groups, sport clubs, and academic clubs reported higher levels of school engagement; 2) adolescents who participated in academic clubs reported fewer depressive symptoms; 3) adolescents who participated in art and music clubs reported more trauma symptoms compared to non-participants; and 4) the effects of participation in mentored groups on delinquency and trauma symptoms differed by maltreatment type. These results indicate both possible benefits and risks of organized activity participation for adolescents with certain maltreatment exposures. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: The essay investigates the presence and development of the topic of immigration in Italian music. Insofar as its emergence as a specific subgenre is located in 1991, year of publication of "'O Scarrafone" (The Cockroach) by Pino Daniele, immigration song is recognized as a fairly recent genre in comparison to the older Italian emigration song, to which it is nonetheless linked by a historic and thematic relation. For at least twenty years, the migrant has been represented as a fringe figure - prostitute, beggar, illegal immigrant. This probably contributed to the strengthening of stereotypes, even when motivated by empathic strains, or by a more or less aware paternalistic and moralizing aim. The more militant current of the sub-genre has been characterized by a somewhat hybrid esthetic. It originated from the need to contrast, in an artistic way, nationalistic instances and xenophobic unrests surging to the fore in the 1990s. The latest protagonists of this evolution seem to be the Italian rappers of foreign descent who gained major visibility breaking with the well-established representations of previous decades. © 2018 Centro Studi Emigrazione.

ABSTRACT: Members of the avian family Pipridae (manakins) have served as a model system for studies aimed at understanding cooperation among individuals, traits involved in sexual selection and the evolution of female preferences. These studies rely on a detailed natural history baseline, yet multiple manakin taxa remain unstudied, precluding comparative analyses and assessment of geographical variation. The Blue-backed Manakin Chiroxiphia pareola is a widely distributed species with four recognized subspecies; however, most published information on display behaviour, social organization and vocalizations are derived from an island population of one subspecies, Chiroxiphia pareola atlantica. To describe the social organization and patterns of activity of the subspecies C. p. napensis, we studied a population in eastern Ecuador and collected data from seven display areas or leks within the Tiputini Biodiversity Station. We used focal observations, camera traps and automatic song recorders to collect information for the field seasons from January to March 2013 and video cameras from February to March 2014. Males were active most of the day with a peak in activity at noon. Display areas were occupied by one to five males, ranging from > 2 to > 18 years old. The vocal repertoire included duet song displays and a variety of calls. We provide sonograms for all six observed vocalizations, including two previously unrecorded vocalizations for the species, and comment on the possible behavioural context of each vocalization. We describe five distinct display elements and the dance display behaviour, and highlight differences relative to other species of the genus. The first part of the dance display involved cooperative dancing, whereas the second part was a solo display, usually performed by alpha males. Our work reveals some differences between C. p. napensis and C. p. atlantica, such as a possible aggressive interaction between males of different ages and hierarchical status that has not been reported before and the apparent absence of mechanical wing sounds in C. p. napensis. The data reported here help advance our knowledge of the evolution of display behaviour among manakins. © 2017 British Ornithologists’ Union

ABSTRACT: We present a taxonomy of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods currently applied for algorithmic music composition. The area known as algorithmic music composition concerns the research on processes of composing music pieces automatically by a computer system. The use of AI for algorithmic music consists on the application of AI techniques as the main tools for the composition generation. There are several models of AI used in music composition such as: heuristics in evolutionary algorithms, neural networks, stochastic methods, generative models, agents, decision trees, declarative programming and grammatical representation. In this survey we present the trending in techniques for automatic music composition. We summarized several research projects of the last seven years and highlight the directions of music composition based on AI techniques. © 2018 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Bob Fosse's work continues to be the most recognizable of the great choreographers of Broadway's post-World War II golden age. This book offers deep analysis of Fosse's development as a choreographer, including the various dance influences he absorbed as a young performer. It examines key Fosse dances and contextualizes them across his career. It looks at how he influenced changes in the musical theater, particularly as a director, and how early mentors George Abbott and Jerome Robbins shaped his theatrical outlook. It compares his work to that of peers like Robbins, Gower Champion, Michael Bennett, and others. The book also examines his choreography for film and looks at how his film experiences influenced his stage work. It also considers the impact of his three marriages-all to dancers-on his career. Finally, the book investigates how Fosse's evolution as both artist and individual mirrored the social and political climate of his era and allowed him to comfortably ride a wave of cultural changes. © Oxford University Press 2018.

ABSTRACT: Background: A fairly rich amount of experimental spectroscopic data have disclosed intriguing properties of the nuclei in the region of neutron rich oxygen isotopes up to the neutron dripline. They, therefore, represent a unique laboratory for studying the evolution of nuclear structure away from the stability line. Purpose: We intend to give an exhaustive microscopic description of low and high energy spectra, dipole response, weak, and electromagnetic properties of the even O22 and the odd O23 and F23. Method: An equation of motion phonon method generates an orthonormal basis of correlated n-phonon states (n=0,1,2) built of constituent Tamm-Dancoff phonons. This basis is adopted to solve the full eigenvalue equations in even nuclei and to construct an orthonormal particle-core basis for the eigenvalue problem in odd nuclei. No approximations are involved and the Pauli principle is taken into full account. The method is adopted to perform self-consistent, parameter free, calculations using an optimized chiral nucleon-nucleon interaction in a space encompassing up to two-phonon basis states. Results: The computed spectra in O22 and O23 and the dipole cross section in O22 are in overall agreement with the experimental data. The calculation describes poorly the spectrum of F23. Conclusions: The two-phonon configurations play a crucial role in the description of spectra and transitions. The large discrepancies concerning the spectra of F23 are ultimately traced back to the large separation between the Hartree-Fock levels belonging to different major shells. We suggest that a more compact single particle spectrum is needed and can be generated by a new chiral potential which includes explicitly the contribution of the three-body forces. © 2018 American Physical Society.

ABSTRACT: The Musicacoustica-Beijing festival in Beijing, as the largest scale, highest standard and most widely influential professional electroacoustic music activity in Asia, has aroused great attention and strong reactions from domestic and overseas specialists, scholars and media. It has become an important example for such international electroacoustic music events in Asia. Musicacoustica-Beijing offers an open window for scrutiny of electroacoustic music from multiple countries and in different genres at the beginning of the twenty-first century. In just twenty years, Musicacoustica has rapidly developed from a non-scheduled, small-scale music activity to the largest and most widely attended electroacoustic music festival in Asia. The great success achieved, the artistic value reflected, and the quality of research topics discussed has not been ignored. Also, the development of Musicacoustica has undergone a process of long exploration and evolving practices. Its concept and aspirations have experienced an evolution towards innovation and refinement. This in-depth study of the development of Musicacoustica sheds light on the history and current situation of Chinese electroacoustic music. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Summer music festivals that involve a few days of camping have often been linked to sustainability agendas. Yet relevant studies have so far overlooked how these events can themselves serve as experiments in less resource consumptive living. Building on a wider interest in the cultural evolution of cleanliness norms, this paper explores how attendees come to use water in personal washing at two UK festivals. Through survey, observation and interview research, it examines how current festival goers respond to the disruption of their usual washing regimes, paying particular attention to how a combination of social and infrastructural cues serves to encourage the emergence of a temporary new cleanliness culture. Doing so highlights the value of seeing human resource consumption as a matter of dynamic collective convention more than fixed personal preference since these respondents were seen to embrace a new relationship with washing that was otherwise deemed unthinkable. This leads to a broader discussion of how visitor needs and the social world are most usefully studied by both future festival organisers and the wider field of sustainable tourism research. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: The mechanical music automata have been developed since thousands years ago for mimicking sound of animals or playing a melody. They are documented and/or preserved in many countries, with solutions that reflect the evolution of mechanical manufacture and technology in these areas. In this article, a timeline of the ancient literature in both western and eastern countries is arranged to clarify the historical development of music-playing automata. The functional mechanical design parameters are arranged based on the four fundamental music characteristics as pitch, duration, intensity and timbre. Moreover, the mechanical music generators are also classified into wind, percussion, strings instruments and the steel music comb according to their composition. These music-playing automata are analyzed in four main units, namely power system, music generator, transmission and mechanical puppets. Finally, seven ancient automata are analyzed as illustrative examples from the viewpoint of mechanism design for these analysis and classification. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: In musicology, there has been a long debate about a meaningful partitioning and description of music history regarding composition styles. Particularly, concepts of historical periods have been criticized since they cannot account for the continuous and interwoven evolution of style. To systematically study this evolution, large corpora are necessary suggesting the use of computational strategies. This article presents such strategies and experiments relying on a dataset of 2000 audio recordings, which cover more than 300 years of music history. From the recordings, we extract different tonal features. We propose a method to visualize these features over the course of history using evolution curves. With the curves, we re-trace hypotheses concerning the evolution of chord transitions, intervals, and tonal complexity. Furthermore, we perform unsupervised clustering of recordings across composition years, individual pieces, and composers. In these studies, we found independent evidence of historical periods that broadly agrees with traditional views as well as recent data-driven experiments. This shows that computational experiments can provide novel insights into the evolution of styles. © 2018, The Author(s) 2018.

ABSTRACT: Scholarship of Samuel Beckett's drama often calls attention to the playwright's engagement with sound and musicality. Building on this scholarship, this article takes a musically informed sound studies approach to Endgame, examining the acoustic effects of the play's musical elements. Such an approach both reveals that musicality lies at the heart of Beckett's famous scepticism of discursive language and challenges existing conceptions of the evolution of Beckett's dramatic style. Drawing connections between Endgame and Play, the work widely considered to have initiated Beckett's late style, the article argues that the type of linguistic denaturing associated with that late style is traceable to Endgame's particular brand of musicality - a musicality "frustrated" by language's ultimate inability to become instrumental music. © University of Toronto.

ABSTRACT: Induction motors are used in a variety of industrial applications where frequent startup cycles are required. In those cases, it is necessary to apply sophisticated signal processing analysis methods in order to reliably follow the time evolution of fault-related harmonics in the signal. In this paper, the zero-sequence current (ZSC) is analyzed using the high-resolution spectral method of multiple signal classification. The analysis of the ZSC signal has proved to have several advantages over the analysis of a single-phase current waveform. The method is validated through simulation and experimental results. The simulations are carried out for a 1.1-MW and a 4-kW induction motors under finite element analysis. Experimentation is performed on a healthy motor, a motor with one broken rotor bar, and a motor with two broken rotor bars. The analysis results are satisfactory since the proposed methodology reliably detects the broken rotor bar fault and its severity, both during transient and steady-state operation of the induction motor. © 2012 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Twenty-five years ago, just as the Cold War ended with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the suitably-titled West German goth fanzine Glasnost announced that a festival called Wave-Gotik-Treffen was to be held in the East German city of Leipzig. Today, the Wave-Gotik-Treffen is the biggest such festival in the world. Initially, however, its significance lay in allowing East and West German goths to meet and dance together, revealing differences in their respective experiences and understanding of the dark subculture. This article will examine two inter-related questions. First, what was the relationship between ‘goth’, as a music and aesthetic, across the frontier of the cold war? Second, to what extent were the goth subcultures of East and West Germany informed by and understood in relation to the original goth subculture emergent within the UK? The article will feed into the debate on the politics of youth culture, but also on the ways by which subcultural meanings and identities are transmitted and redefined across national borders. © Edinburgh University Press.

ABSTRACT: This article deals with the reframing of the concept of universal mediated communication on a global scale. Subjects include the following: the universe has a conscious force field at all its scales, requiring continuous inter-scale communication of information; the field exhibits distinct electromagnetic frequencies associated with the building blocks of life; and advances in the technology of sound production with electronic synthesizers can be applied to study mechanisms of such universal communication. The question being addressed is how electronic synthesizers can be used to create sonic xenolinguistic expressions when composing with sonified frequencies obtained from bio-organisms, human protein structures, phonemes and various types of interstellar frequencies that include, but are not limited to, gamma bursts, pulsars and neutron stars. The objective is to construct sonic xenolingusitic expressions that can act like feedback loops within the field of consciousness. These sonic expressions can include anomalous cognitive, emotive or spiritual experiences that may be emerging out of the universal field of consciousness in real time. Xenolinguistics is a hypothetical language used to communicate with other sentient beings in the universe. The rationale for composing sonic xenolingustic expressions is the belief that the universe is considered conscious and that there is a field of consciousness existing throughout the universe that in principle is also instrumental in how communication can evolve with extraterrestrials. Outlines of other attempts at extraterrestrial communication by other researchers will be offered based on current literature. The probability that other life forms have established some mode of information exchange that is detectable and that, in return, may be able to create a form of communication to respond will be covered. It is postulated that various energy fields existing before and after the creation of our universe interacted with one another becoming abiotic, and then over time, formed even more complex structures. It is these complex structures that were then able to communicate essential information for maintaining their stability and survivability by using specific signalling frequencies. It is hypothesized that first life in the universe emerged within an already existing field of information and that our consciousness is thereby able to establish communication with other forms of consciousness in the universe. It is on this basis that a novel scientific and philosophical paradigm is considered in which the universe is conceived of as an active information matrix that can entertain potential extraterrestrial communication. In this framework, the present article will offer a new approach to orchestrated electronic sounds as a means to such communication. By integrating quantum physical properties into that sonic framework, a new study emerged on how sonic xenolinguistic elements can be incorporated into electronic composition techniques. This new framework may produce new algorithms for musical expression that not only represent an innovative future of electronic music but may also be crucial in the formulation and induction of new states of consciousness that will enable humankind to directly participate in the further becoming of the universe as a result of the evolution of this universal field of consciousness. © 2018 Intellect Ltd Article.

ABSTRACT: In Nancy Huston’s 1994 novel, La Virevolte, and her 1996 English translation, Slow Emergencies, her protagonist struggles to balance motherhood and her career to no avail, finally abandoning her family to devote herself to dance. Huston’s profoundly moving analysis of the family dynamics before and after a mother’s abandonment reveals a real desire to negotiate the complexities of motherhood. In this paper, the character’s evolution is analyzed through the lens of de Beauvoir’s theories on maternal instinct and mothering. © 2018 Department of Romance Languages and Literatures.

ABSTRACT: Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm is used in many domains of computation, including optimization, clustering and classification tasks. Further, honey bees dancing is one of the most fascinating and intriguing behaviours of animal life. Honey bees’ dancing is termed as “waggle Dance” in literature and they perform it for indicating the food sources in their environment. This work presents a novel honey bees dancing language (HBDL)-based algorithm for mining the induction rules from datasets. The proposed HBDL algorithm is implemented and tested against the performance of ABC, Particle Swarm Optimization and nine more traditional algorithms frequently used by researchers. The experimental results showed that HBDL is a suitable and effective technique for data mining and classification task. © 2018, Indian Academy of Sciences.

ABSTRACT: Neural oscillations can synchronize to external rhythmic stimuli, as for example in speech and music. While previous studies have mainly focused on elucidating the fundamental concept of neural entrainment, less is known about the time course of entrainment. In this human electroencephalography (EEG) study, we unravel the temporal evolution of neural entrainment by contrasting short and long periods of rhythmic stimulation. Listeners had to detect short silent gaps that were systematically distributed with respect to the phase of a 3 Hz frequency-modulated tone. We found that gap detection performance was modulated by the stimulus stream with a consistent stimulus phase across participants for short and long stimulation. Electrophysiological analysis confirmed neural entrainment effects at 3 Hz and the 6 Hz harmonic for both short and long stimulation lengths. 3 Hz source level analysis revealed that longer stimulation resulted in a phase shift of a participant's neural phase relative to the stimulus phase. Phase coupling increased over the first second of stimulation, but no effects for phase coupling strength were observed over time. The dynamic evolution of phase alignment suggests that the brain attunes to external rhythmic stimulation by adapting the brain's internal representation of incoming environmental stimuli. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Language and music share many commonalities, both as natural phenomena and as subjects of intellectual inquiry. Rather than exhaustively reviewing these connections, we focus on potential cross-pollination of methodological inquiries and attitudes. We highlight areas in which scholarship on the evolution of language may inform the evolution of music. We focus on the value of coupled empirical and formal methodologies, and on the futility of mysterianism, the declining view that the nature, origins and evolution of language cannot be addressed empirically. We identify key areas in which the evolution of language as a discipline has flourished historically, and suggest ways in which these advances can be integrated into the study of the evolution of music. © 2018 Ravignani, Thompson and Filippi.

ABSTRACT: Humans use music for a variety of social functions: we sing to accompany dance, to soothe babies, to heal illness, to communicate love, and so on. Across animal taxa, vocalization forms are shaped by their functions, including in humans. Here, we show that vocal music exhibits recurrent, distinct, and cross-culturally robust form-function relations that are detectable by listeners across the globe. In Experiment 1, internet users (n = 750) in 60 countries listened to brief excerpts of songs, rating each song's function on six dimensions (e.g., “used to soothe a baby”). Excerpts were drawn from a geographically stratified pseudorandom sample of dance songs, lullabies, healing songs, and love songs recorded in 86 mostly small-scale societies, including hunter-gatherers, pastoralists, and subsistence farmers. Experiment 1 and its analysis plan were pre-registered. Despite participants’ unfamiliarity with the societies represented, the random sampling of each excerpt, their very short duration (14 s), and the enormous diversity of this music, the ratings demonstrated accurate and cross-culturally reliable inferences about song functions on the basis of song forms alone. In Experiment 2, internet users (n = 1,000) in the United States and India rated three contextual features (e.g., gender of singer) and seven musical features (e.g., melodic complexity) of each excerpt. The songs’ contextual features were predictive of Experiment 1 function ratings, but musical features and the songs’ actual functions explained unique variance in function ratings. These findings are consistent with the existence of universal links between form and function in vocal music. Mehr and Singh et al. show form-function associations in vocal music detectable by listeners worldwide. People in 60 countries heard songs from 86 societies. They inferred the functions of dance, lullaby, and healing from song forms alone. Ratings were nearly identical across listener cohorts and were guided by the contextual and musical features of the songs. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: The US Environmental Protection Agency's storm water management model SWMM 5·1 is widely used to simulate urban drainage processes both for qualitative and quantitative analysis. In the present work, SWMM 5·1 was applied to the Fossolo urban sub-catchment in Bologna, Italy, and the geographic information system ArcGIS was adopted to reproduce the spatial distribution of rainfall. An innovative and original optimisation procedure was developed, coupling the jazz-music-based harmony search evolutionary algorithm with SWMM 5·1 for the estimation of runoff parameters. Seven historical storm events were taken into account for model calibration and validation. A careful sensitivity analysis highlighted the effectiveness of the calibrated parameters for simulations. The results obtained showed the proposed approach to be a useful tool for the calibration of hydrological parameters in large urban drainage systems, defining a satisfactory correlation between modelled and measured data.

ABSTRACT: Harmony search (HS) is a new evolutionary algorithm inspired by the process of music improvisation. During the past decade, HS has shown excellent performance in many fields. However, its search strategy often demonstrates insufficient exploitation ability when facing some complex practical problems. Moreover, the HS performance is significantly influenced by its control parameters. To enhance the search efficiency, an adaptive harmony search with best-based search strategy (ABHS) is proposed. In the search process, ABHS exploits the beneficial information from the global-best solution to improve the search ability, while it adaptively tunes its control parameters according to the feedback from the search process. Experiments are conducted on a set of classical test functions. The experimental results show that ABHS significantly enhances the search efficiency of HS. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Background: The evolution of three-dimensional printing into prosthetics has opened conversations about the availability and cost of prostheses. This report will discuss how a prosthetic team incorporated additive manufacture techniques into the treatment of a patient with a partial hand amputation to create and test a unique assistive device which he could use to hold his French horn. Case description and methods: Using a process of shape capture, photogrammetry, computer-aided design and finite element analysis, a suitable assistive device was designed and tested. The design was fabricated using three-dimensional printing. Patient satisfaction was measured using a Pugh’s Matrix™, and a cost comparison was made between the process used and traditional manufacturing. Findings and outcomes: Patient satisfaction was high. The three-dimensional printed devices were 56% cheaper to fabricate than a similar laminated device. Conclusion: Computer-aided design and three-dimensional printing proved to be an effective method for designing, testing and fabricating a unique assistive device. Clinical relevance: CAD and 3D printing techniques can enable devices to be designed, tested and fabricated cheaper than when using traditional techniques. This may lead to improvements in quality and accessibility. © 2017, © The International Society for Prosthetics and Orthotics 2017.

ABSTRACT: The spontaneous ability to entrain to meter periodicities is central to music perception and production across cultures. There is increasing evidence that this ability involves selective neural responses to meter-related frequencies. This phenomenon has been observed in the human auditory cortex, yet it could be the product of evolutionarily older lower-level properties of brainstem auditory neurons, as suggested by recent recordings from rodent midbrain. We addressed this question by taking advantage of a new method to simultaneously record human EEG activity originating from cortical and lower-level sources, in the form of slow (< 20 Hz) and fast (> 150 Hz) responses to auditory rhythms. Cortical responses showed increased amplitudes at meter-related frequencies compared to meter-unrelated frequencies, regardless of the prominence of the meter-related frequencies in the modulation spectrum of the rhythmic inputs. In contrast, frequency-following responses showed increased amplitudes at meter-related frequencies only in rhythms with prominent meter-related frequencies in the input but not for a more complex rhythm requiring more endogenous generation of the meter. This interaction with rhythm complexity suggests that the selective enhancement of meter-related frequencies does not fully rely on subcortical auditory properties, but is critically shaped at the cortical level, possibly through functional connections between the auditory cortex and other, movement-related, brain structures. This process of temporal selection would thus enable endogenous and motor entrainment to emerge with substantial flexibility and invariance with respect to the rhythmic input in humans in contrast with non-human animals. © 2018 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

ABSTRACT: In recent years the explosive growth of information affects the flood of information. The amount of information must be followed by the development of the effective Information Retrieval System (IRS) so that the information will be easily accessible and useful for the user. The source of Information contains various media format, beside text there is also image, audio, and video that called multimedia. A large number of multimedia information rise the Multimedia Information Retrieval System (MIRS). Most of MIRS today is monolithic or only using one media format like Google1 for text search, tineye2 for image search, youtube3 for video search or 4shared4 for music and audio search. There is a need of information in any kind of media, not only retrieve the document in text format, but also retrieve the document in an image, audio and video format at once from any kind media format of the query. This study reviews the evolution of IRS, regress from text-based to concept-based MIRS. Unified Multimedia Indexing technique is discussed along with Concept-based MIRS. This critical review concludes that the evolution of IRS follows three paces: content-based, context-based and concept-based. Each pace takes on indexing system and retrieval techniques to optimize information retrieved. The challenge is how to come up with a retrieval technique that can process unified MIRS in order to retrieve optimally the relevant document. © 2017 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: This paper proposes an evolution model and an analysis of the behavior of music consumers on online music streaming services. While previous studies have observed power-law degree distributions of usage in online music streaming services, the underlying behavior of users has not been well understood. Users and songs can be described using a bipartite network where an edge exists between a user node and a song node when the user has listened that song. The growth mechanism of bipartite networks has been used to understand the evolution of online bipartite networks Zhang et al. (2013). Existing bipartite models are based on a preferential attachment mechanism László Barabási and Albert (1999) in which the probability that a user listens to a song is proportional to its current popularity. This mechanism does not allow for two types of real world phenomena. First, a newly released song with high quality sometimes quickly gains popularity. Second, the popularity of songs normally decreases as time goes by. Therefore, this paper proposes a new model that is more suitable for online music services by adding fitness and aging functions to the song nodes of the bipartite network proposed by Zhang et al. (2013). Theoretical analyses are performed for the degree distribution of songs. Empirical data from an online streaming service, Last.fm, are used to confirm the degree distribution of the object nodes. Simulation results show improvements from a previous model. Finally, to illustrate the application of the proposed model, a simplified royalty cost model for online music services is used to demonstrate how the changes in the proposed parameters can affect the costs for online music streaming providers. Managerial implications are also discussed. © 2017

ABSTRACT: Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) creations include, amongst other, music, dance, singing, theatre, human skills and craftsmanship. These cultural expressions are usually transmitted orally and/or using gestures and are modified over a period of time, through a process of collective recreation. As the world becomes more interconnected and many different cultures come into contact, local communities run the risk of losing important elements of their ICH, while young people find it difficult to maintain the connection with the cultural heritage treasured by their elders. In this paper, we present a novel holistic approach for the safeguarding and transmission of ICH that goes beyond the mere digitization of ICH content. Based on multisensory technology for the capturing of ICH, the proposed approach enables the generation of completely novel cultural content. High-level semantics are extracted from the acquired data, enabling researchers to identify possible implicit or hidden correlations between different ICH expressions or interpretation styles and study the evolution of a specific ICH. This data, coupled with other cultural resources, is accessible through the i-Treasures Web-platform, which provides the means for supporting knowledge exchange between researchers as well as know-how transmission from ICH bearers to apprentices.

ABSTRACT: Dance and technology have been partners from an early age. In 1892 Loie Fuller recognized the potential in the latest theater lighting technologies that would enable her to creatively explore her dance and dance performance. Like Fuller, as technologies emerged to the world at large, dance artists began to explore the effect such technologies would have on their art. Eventually, explorations of dance and technology focused on how computers contributed to the performance of dance. This chapter will review the history of dance and technology culminating into a discussion of the next evolution of technology in the discipline of dance, the potential computational thinking and Big Data bring to the visualization of the creative process. Particular emphasis will focus on how the work, Synchronous Objects One Flat Thing reproduced, exemplifies the convergence of dance, technology, Big Data and visualization. © 2018, IGI Global.

ABSTRACT: The urge to move to music is universal among humans. Unlike visual art, which is manifest across space, music is manifest across time. When listeners get carried away by the music, either through movement (such as dancing) or through reverie (such as trance), it is usually the temporal qualities of the music--its pulse, tempo, and rhythmic patterns--that put them in this state. In this article, we review studies addressing rhythm, meter, movement, synchronization, entrainment, the perception of groove, and other temporal factors that constitute a first step to understanding how and why music literally moves us. The experiments we review span a range of methodological techniques, including neuroimaging, psychophysics, and traditional behavioral experiments, and we also summarize the current studies of animal synchronization, engaging an evolutionary perspective on human rhythmic perception and cognition.

ABSTRACT: ‘From Selling Out to Savvy Strategy’ focuses on the way independent music became more popular as a result of a number of industrial and cultural factors upon which The O.C. was able to capitalize, examines the discourse around the licensing of music at the time of its production, and illustrates how the show encapsulates an evolutionary moment in the history of indie music on television. Focusing on The O.C. is important for addressing how the changing cultural position of music genres and the economic realities of converging media are intricately interwoven. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Music is part of the human nature, and it is also philogenically relevant to language evolution. Language and music are bound together in the enhancement of important social functions, such as communication, cooperation and social cohesion. In the last few years, there has been growing evidence that music and music therapy may improve communication skills (but not only) in different neurological disorders. One of the plausible reasons concerning the rational use of sound and music in neurorehabilitation is the possibility to stimulate brain areas involved in emotional processing and motor control, such as the fronto-parietal network. In this narrative review, we are going to describe the role of music therapy in improving aphasia and other neurological disorders, underlying the reasons why this tool could be effective in rehabilitative settings, especially in individuals affected by stroke. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Musical chords are combinations of two or more tones played together. While many different chords are used in music, some are heard as more attractive (consonant) than others. We have previously suggested that, for reasons of biological advantage, human tonal preferences can be understood in terms of the spectral similarity of tone combinations to harmonic human vocalizations. Using the chromatic scale, we tested this theory further by assessing the perceived consonance of all possible dyads, triads, and tetrads within a single octave. Our results show that the consonance of chords is predicted by their relative similarity to voiced speech sounds. These observations support the hypothesis that the relative attraction of musical tone combinations is due, at least in part, to the biological advantages that accrue from recognizing and responding to conspecific vocal stimuli.

ABSTRACT: “Que Marianne était jolie,” a well-known French popular song of the 1970s, is a space of possibilities, a realm of “cross-cultural events,” where interpretation is deeply rooted in French history and societal evolution. The main complexity in deciphering the coded meaning of its lyrics is to analyze the source space and time (first element of the binary code: the revolutionary codification), and to view how the same symbols were “appropriated, translated, rehistorized, and read anew” in the song (second element of the binary code: the republican codification). The use of visual art as an interpretative tool here aims at better decoding and reading the contexts, the concepts and the shifts in meanings, and ensuring we can comprehend the main character, plot, and settings implicit in this pop song. © 2017 by The Cardozo School of Law of Yeshiva University.

ABSTRACT: Fin de siècle cancan dancers Jane Avril and Louise Weber (La Goulue) examined alongside the musical dance and song number “Big Spender” from Sweet Charity serve as examples of how decontextualization of images leads to essentializing the subject of the image that gives precedence to a male gaze focus. In analyzing lasting images of each form, not only through a lens of gaze theory, but with an attention to the evolution of concepts within the gaze, specifically John Berger’s Ways of Knowing and Amelia Jones’s Seeing Differently, perspective can be gleaned in approach to interaction with such works. Additionally, application of sociopolitical context bolsters perspective on the lives of the dancers, artists, and our own perception. Depth of interaction with these pieces sheds light on their value in subverting and distorting patriarchal structures that need to be understood and considered in contemporary collaboration with them. ©, Copyright © National Dance Education Organization.

ABSTRACT: Academic debate has long surrounded the term 'community,' first defined as a sociological construct in the late nineteenth century. In the 1990s, widespread Internet use disrupted earlier ideas of what defines and bounds community, but there is now general scholarly consensus that online affinity groups can also function as communities, including those focused on any number of different music genres. In this chapter, I posit that online music communities can function as significant spaces of community music activity. This discussion includes contextualizing the online community by drawing on New Media literature on the evolution of online groups, theories, research, and frameworks of online community; illustrations of practice from current online and convergent music communities; the role of social media in online music communities; online music community as community music outreach; and implications for current and future implications for practice. © Oxford University Press 2018.

ABSTRACT: Music as a Chariot offers a multidisciplinary perspective whose primary proposition is that theatre is a type of music. Understanding how music enables the theatre experience helps to shape our entire approach to the performing arts. Beginning with a discussion on the origin and nature of time, the author takes us on an evolutionary journey to discover how music, language and mimesis co-evolved, eventually coming together to produce the complex way we experience theatre. The book integrates the evolutionary neuroscience of the human brain into this journey, offering practical implications and applications for the auditory expression of this concept-namely the fundamental techniques artists use to create sound scores for theatre. With contributions from directors, playwrights, actors and designers, Music as a Chariot explores the use of music to carry ideas into the human soul-a concept that extends beyond the theatrical to include film, video gaming, dance, or anywhere art is manipulated in time. © 2018 Richard K.

ABSTRACT: Language- and music-readiness are demonstrated as related within comparative neuroprimatology by elaborating three hypotheses concerning music-readiness (MR): The (musicological) rhythm-first hypothesis (MR-1), the combinatoriality hypothesis (MR-2), and the socio-affect-cohesion hypothesis (MR-3). MR-1 states that rhythm precedes evolutionarily melody and tonality. MR-2 states that complex imitation and fractionation within the expanding spiral of the mirror system/complex imitation hypothesis (MS/CIH) lead to the combinatorial capacities of rhythm necessary for building up a musical lexicon and complex structures; and rhythm, in connection with repetition and variation, scaffolds both musical form and content. MR-3 states that music’s main evolutionary function is to self-induce affective states in individuals to cope with distress; rhythm, in particular isochrony, provides a temporal framework to support movement synchronization, inducing shared affective states in group members, which in turn enhances group cohesion. This document reviews current behavioural and neurocognitive research relevant to the comparative neuroprimatology of music-readiness. It further proposes to extend MS/CIH through the evolution of the relationship of the language- and music-ready brain, by comparing “affective rhythm” and prosody – i.e. by comparatively approaching the language- and music-emotion link in neuroprimatology. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.

ABSTRACT: Why does musical rhythm have the structure it does? Musical rhythm, in all its cross-cultural diversity, exhibits commonalities across world cultures. Traditionally, music research has been split into two fields. Some scientists focused on musicality, namely the human biocognitive predispositions for music, with an emphasis on cross-cultural similarities. Other scholars investigated music, seen as a cultural product, focusing on the variation in world musical cultures. Recent experiments found deep connections between music and musicality, reconciling these opposing views. Here, we address the question of how individual cognitive biases affect the process of cultural evolution of music. Data from two experiments are analyzed using two complementary techniques. In the experiments, participants hear drumming patterns and imitate them. These patterns are then given to the same or another participant to imitate. The structure of these initially random patterns is tracked along experimental "generations." Frequentist statistics show how participants' biases are amplified by cultural transmission, making drumming patterns more structured. Structure is achieved faster in transmission within rather than between participants. A Bayesian model approximates the motif structures participants learned and created. Our data and models suggest that individual biases for musicality may shape the cultural transmission of musical rhythm. © 2018 The New York Academy of Sciences.

ABSTRACT: This chapter examines a range of approaches to algorithmic music making inspired by biological systems, and considers topics at the intersection of contemporary music, computer science, and computational creativity. A summary of core precursor movements both within and beyond musical practice (A Life, cybernetics, systems art, etc.) sets the scene, before core models and algorithms are introduced and illustrated. These include evolutionary algorithms, agent-based modelling and self-organizing systems, adaptive behaviour and interactive performance systems, and ecosystemic approaches to composition and computational creative discovery. The chapter closes by reviewing themes for future work in this area: autonomy and agency, and the poetics of biologically inspired algorithms. © Oxford University Press 2018. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Music regional classification, which is an important branch of music automatic classification, aims at classifying folk songs according to different regional style. Chinese folk songs have developed various regional musical styles in the process of its evolution. Regional classification of Chinese folk songs can promote the development of music recommendation systems which recommending proper style of music to users and improve the efficiency of the music retrieval system. However, the accuracy of existing music regional classification systems is not high enough, because most methods do not consider temporal characteristics of music for both features extraction and classification. In this paper, we proposed an approach based on conditional random field (CRF) which can fully take advantage of the temporal characteristics of musical audio features for music regional classification. Considering the continuity, high dimensionality and large size of the audio feature data, we employed two ways to calculate the label sequence of musical audio features in CRF, which are Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method based on CRF-RBM outperforms other existing music regional classifiers with the best accuracy of 84.71% on Chinese folk songs datasets. Besides, when the proposed methods were applied to the Greek folk songs dataset, the CRF-RBM model also performs the best. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: The paper describes a novel multi-objective evolutionary algorithm implementation that generates short musical ideas consisting of a melody and abstract harmonization, developed in tandem. The system is capable of creating these ideas based on provided material or autonomously. Three automated fitness features were adapted to the model to evaluate the generated music during evolution, and a fourth was developed to ensure harmonic progression. Four rhythmical pattern matching features were also developed. 21 pieces of music, produced by the system under various configurations, were evaluated in a user study. The results indicate that the system is capable of composing musical ideas that are subjectively interesting and pleasant, but not consistently. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

ABSTRACT: This chapter explores how experimentation and improvisation became meaningful within the Colombian Western academic tradition. Acosta provides a musicological report of the evolution of experimental composition, interpretation, and improvisation in Bogotá toward the end of the twentieth century. The rise of atonality, electroacoustic and mixed music, indeterminacy, and other avant-garde movements from the late 1950s onward, are sketched as direct precedents for the rise of experimental improvisational practices since the 1980s. These tendencies grew into a rich field within Colombian music throughout the last decades of the century, with the appearance of improvisation/experimental music ensembles in which composers, performers, and improvisers found creative outlets. This process is traced, along with the significant proliferation of performance situations, as well as the reactions of artistic, educational, and governmental institutions to the developing field. © Oxford University Press 2018.

ABSTRACT: This article examines the creative process of Diatope, a multimedia project created by Iannis Xenakis in 1978 for the inauguration of the Centre Pompidou in Paris, utilizing analytical research of sources found in several archives. By interpreting Xenakis's sketches and plans, the article elucidates for the first time the spatialization of La Légende d'Eer, the music featured in the Diatope. The findings of the research underline the importance of graphic and geometric representation for understanding Xenakis's thinking, and they highlight the continuity and evolution of his theory and practice over time. Furthermore, the research findings present the means by which this key work of electroacoustic music might be spatialized today, now that the original space of the Diatope no longer exists. © 2018 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

ABSTRACT: When searching for genetic markers inherited together with musical aptitude, genes affecting inner ear development and brain function were identified. The alpha-synuclein gene (SNCA), located in the most significant linkage region of musical aptitude, was overexpressed when listening and performing music. The GATA-binding protein 2 gene (GATA2) was located in the best associated region of musical aptitude and regulates SNCA in dopaminergic neurons, thus linking DNA-and RNA-based studies of music-related traits together. In addition to SNCA, several other genes were linked to dopamine metabolism. Mutations in SNCA predispose to Lewy-body dementia and cause Parkinson disease in humans and affect song production in songbirds. Several other birdsong genes were found in transcriptome analysis, suggesting a common evolutionary background of sound perception and production in humans and songbirds. Regions of positive selection with musical aptitude contained genes affecting auditory perception, cognitive performance, memory, human language development, and song perception and production of songbirds. The data support the role of dopaminergic pathway and their link to the reward mechanism as a molecular determinant in positive selection of music. Integration of gene-level data from the literature across multiple species prioritized activity-dependent immediate early genes as candidate genes in musical aptitude and listening to and performing music. © 2018 New York Academy of Sciences.

ABSTRACT: An extended Boolean network model is investigated as a possible medium in which a human composer can write music. A Boolean network is a simple discrete-time dynamical system whose state is characterised by the states of its constituent Boolean-valued vertices. The evolution of the system is predetermined by an initial state and the properties of the activation functions associated with each vertex. By associating musical events with the states of the system, its trajectory from a particular start state can be interpreted as a piece of tonal music. The primary source of interest in composing music using a deterministic dynamical system is the dependence of the musical result on the initial conditions. This paper explores the possibility of producing musically interesting variations on a given melodic phrase by changing the initial conditions from which the generating dynamical system is started. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

ABSTRACT: Infants typically experience music through social interactions with others. One such experience involves caregivers singing to infants while holding and bouncing them rhythmically. These highly social interactions shape infant music perception and may also influence social cognition and behavior. Moving in time with others-interpersonal synchrony-can direct infants' social preferences and prosocial behavior. Infants also show social preferences and selective prosociality toward singers of familiar, socially learned melodies. Here, we discuss recent studies of the influence of musical engagement on infant social cognition and behavior, highlighting the importance of rhythmic movement and socially relevant melodies. © 2018 The New York Academy of Sciences.

ABSTRACT: Queen are considered one of the most successful rock bands in the history of British rock music and several of their albums and singles have enjoyed sustained runs in the charts throughout the world. While this group have occasionally been underestimated due to their extravagance and to a supposedly outdated musical style, their records now appear as undeniably representative of the sound of the 1970s and the 1980s by encapsulating a variety of influences and sub-genres of popular music. In addition, the band's ability to mirror-even involuntarily-profound evolutions within British society at the time may help see Queen as historically relevant beyond their mere contribution to the world of rock music. © 2018 Klincksieck.

ABSTRACT: Music is a human universal, which suggests a biological adaptation. Several evolutionary explanations have been proposed, covering the entire spectrum of natural, sexual, and group selection. Here we consider the hypothesis that musical behaviour constitutes a reliable or even costly signal of fitness, and thus may have evolved as a human trait through sexual selection. We experimentally tested how musical performance quality (MPQ), in improvisations on the drums, saxophone, and violin, affects mate values and mate preferences perceived by a prospective partner. Swedish student participants (27 of each sex) saw a face of a person of the opposite sex and heard a piece of improvised music being played. The music occurred in three levels of MPQ and the faces in three levels of facial attractiveness (FA). For each parametric combination of MPG and FA, the participants rated four mate value scales (intelligence, health, social status, and parenting skill) and four mate preference scales (date, intercourse, and short- and long term relationship). Consistent with sexual selection theory, mate value ratings were generally increased by MPQ for raters of both sexes. Consistent with more specific hypotheses that follow from combining sexual selection and parental investment theory, women's but not men's preference for a long-term, but not short-term, relationship was significantly increased by MPQ, MPQ generally affected women's ratings more than men's, FA generally affected men's ratings more than women's, and women's ratings of intelligence were even more influenced by MPQ than by FA. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Whether emotions carried by voice and music are processed by the brain using similar mechanisms has long been investigated. Yet neuroimaging studies do not provide a clear picture, mainly due to lack of control over stimuli. Here, we report a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study using comparable stimulus material in the voice and music domains-the Montreal Affective Voices and the Musical Emotional Bursts-which include nonverbal short bursts of happiness, fear, sadness, and neutral expressions. We use a multivariate emotion-classification fMRI analysis involving cross-timbre classification as a means of comparing the neural mechanisms involved in processing emotional information in the two domains. We find, for affective stimuli in the violin, clarinet, or voice timbres, that local fMRI patterns in the bilateral auditory cortex and upper premotor regions support above-chance emotion classification when training and testing sets are performed within the same timbre category. More importantly, classifier performance generalized well across timbre in cross-classifying schemes, albeit with a slight accuracy drop when crossing the voice-music boundary, providing evidence for a shared neural code for processing musical and vocal emotions, with possibly a cost for the voice due to its evolutionary significance. © 2018 The New York Academy of Sciences.

ABSTRACT: In recent years, music and musicality have been the focus of an increasing amount of research effort. This has led to a growing role and visibility of the contribution of (bio)musicology to the field of neuroscience and cognitive sciences at large. While it has been widely acknowledged that there are commonalities between speech, language, and musicality, several researchers explain this by considering musicality as an epiphenomenon of language. However, an alternative hypothesis is that musicality is an innate and widely shared capacity for music that can be seen as a natural, spontaneously developing set of traits based on and constrained by our cognitive abilities and their underlying biology. A comparative study of musicality in humans and well-known animal models (monkeys, birds, pinnipeds) will further our insights on which features of musicality are exclusive to humans and which are shared between humans and nonhuman animals, contribute to an understanding of the musical phenotype, and further constrain existing evolutionary theories of music and musicality. © 2018 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: In this paper, we describe the creation of Musical Organisms using a novel generative music composition approach modeled on biological evolutionary and developmental (Evo Devo) processes. We are interested in using the Evo Devo processes that generate biological organisms with diverse and interesting structures—structures that exhibit modularity, repetition, and hierarchy—in order to create diverse music compositions that exhibit these same structural properties. The current focus of our work has been on Musical Organism development. Our Musical Organisms are musical scores that develop from a single musical note, just as a biological organism develops from a single cell. We describe the musical genome and the non-linear dynamical processes that drive the development of the Musical Organism from single note to complex musical score. While the evolution of Musical Organisms has not been our central focus, we describe how evolution can act upon genomic variation within populations of Musical Organisms to create new Musical Organism species with diverse and complex structures. And we introduce the concept of genome embedding as a unique method for generating genetic variation in a population, and developing structural modularity in Musical Organisms. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

ABSTRACT: The evolutionary process of European music was reflected with special force in the fates of certain genres, including the ricercar fugue. In the 18th century the fugue became one of the most important points of interconnection of many tendencies, a polygon of struggle between the interests of the gallant style and the richest contrapuntal heritage of "learned" music. Complete freedom of choice in regards to the forms, means and possibilities of the "learned" music was revealed by J. S. Bach in "The Art of the Fugue," leaving a field for contemplation. An understanding of the occurring processes was given to the great composers, among which was Mozart. For him the aspiration towards the juncture of characteristic (and the brightest and most perspective) principles of "learned" contrapuntal music and the tendencies of the most current music for his time became the meaning for many concrete artistic creations. The article examines Mozart's Fugue "For Constanze" (KV. 394) as one of the epochal compositions. Seeming in its outward appearance to be a lightweight composition, rather accidental in the history of its appearance, the Fugue presented itself as a personification of a decisive and compositionally conscious turn along the path of search for new forms and unification of various styles. The stylistic features observed in it were defined in musicological literature (namely, by Boris Asafiev) as "Mozartian counterpoint". © 2018 Ufa State Institute of Arts. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: A creative inquiry introduces a swarm simulation as a generative mechanism, providing a third agency in music creation alongside agency of composition and performance. When applying an evolutionary model such as swarms to music the challenge is to develop a performance interaction model beyond improvised explorations so that the model can facilitate the integrities for, and emerging dynamics in, all agencies. To minimize a performer’s cognitive overload another challenge is management of dataflow in interactive architecture for generating music. An interaction model for structured reciprocity is investigated as a design solution that applies model-based indirection. In the scope of musical composition, reciprocity is exhibited as a time dependent relationship between a performer’s actions and evolutionary swarm tendencies applied to generate musical outcomes. Reciprocity is structured using levels of indirection as a construct of mapping data from a swarm simulation to an interactive music performance application. The paper presents an approach to encoding, activating, generating and measuring reciprocity. A comparative case study demonstrates the implementation of these concepts in two musical works. The paper concludes (1) reciprocity in interactive applications helps optimize actions to leverage emergent tendencies, including their intuitive qualities, towards realizing desired outcomes; and (2) data analysis from the case study indicates temporal signatures of reciprocity are related to indirection in interaction scenarios for generative musical performance. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

ABSTRACT: Different studies have proved the importance of language and vocabularies in structuring shared perceptions among stakeholders within an industry. Little is known about the discursive work involved in the evolution of these vocabularies. The use of corpus linguistics provides insights in the process through which an industry stabilises itself and how incumbents engage in discursive work to maintain their interests. We explore the jolt the Internet provoked in the French recorded music industry between 1988 and 2008. We argue that one major explanation for the industry inertia is that the technology of the Internet and the new distribution channels it opened up were framed by discourses, characterized by a relatively stable vocabulary which repeated established words such as right and artistic work. The discursive work of incumbent actors supports the stabilization of this vocabulary. When new words appeared, they were incorporated into existing vocabulary. This dual process of repetition and incorporation was facilitated by the fact that many of the words central to the debate were relatively empty and ambiguous floating signifiers. This paper represents a promising avenue to better account for the place of words in the institutional work and more specifically institutional maintenance. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: In general, musical forms iterate from axioms of pitches and intervals organized by a set of principles, yet when describing music as ‘desirable’ or ‘effective’, we are pointing not to its form, but to our experience of it. In successful music, the composer moves the listener through a series of emotive states in some sense predetermined by the composer, but that are not reducible to the patterns and principles. The argument in this chapter concerns what makes some music capable of eliciting ‘exaltation’ rather than a routine response. Designing chaos into the musical patterns themselves is proposed as one such route. The author uses the evolution of the stochastic processes underlying her ‘aesthetic sonification’ of natural systems and the vocal variabilities of Emma Kirkby and Amy Winehouse to elucidate her thoughts on how chaos can interact with musical forms. Growth in natural systems, while still engaging with ‘choreographed chaos’ has particularly motivated the author. © Oxford University Press 2018. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Among all the conflicts that the U.S. has participated in during the 20th century, the Vietnam War has left the deepest wound in American society. After being proclaimed as a war to defend democracy, the American people showed their disagreement with this intervention. American society expressed their unrest through different ways in literature, cinema, or music. The latter showed the concerns of the beat generation, the hippie movement and all those who opposed the conflict through a music genre: the protest song. This paper analyzes the genre of the protest song through a selection of songwriters and their themes as a source, alongside an exhaustive book documentation about the issue regarding specific topics related to the Vietnam War. By using them, we demonstrate how the conflict affected American society during the 1960s and 1970s and how this war was criticized due to controversial topics such as the arms industry, the recruitment or draft, anti-war protestors, and casualties. This analysis provides a portrait of the conflict and its consequences. In the same way, we investigate the subsequent evolution of a genre that, even though it has remained, has languished after a period of hyperactivity. © 2018 FahrenHouse. All right reserved.

ABSTRACT: The way an improviser practices is a vital and significant aspect to a musician’s means and capacities of expression. Expert music performers utilize extensive self-regulatory processes involving planning, strategic development, and systemized approaches to learning and reflective practice. Scholars posit that these processes are constructivist and socioculturally explained and manifest in individual, jointly negotiated, and shared learning. This qualitative study explores the regulatory processes of four prominent Australian improvising musician-educators and four tertiary improvisation students. Expert and developing musicians’ processes in learning and teaching improvised music-making were investigated through observations of self-regulation, co-regulation, and shared regulation strategies. I identified and analyzed regulatory learning strategies located from practice, training, and experience using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Findings suggest insights of evolving self-regulative behavior that are dynamic, task-specific, personalised, and contextually contingent across individual and collaborative tasks and activity. An integrative regulatory model of learning offers guidance and reflection of metacognitive flow within a social constructed view of learning. Implications for researchers and educators are drawn for meaningful educational practice by knowing and understanding expert improvisers’ complex concepts of self-regulation, critical thinking, problem solving, and the evolution and evaluation of creative processes in improvisers. © 2017, © National Association for Music Education 2017.

ABSTRACT: In Thomas Mann's works, illness cannot be seen as a simple plot element, but rather as a central part of the story's evolution, especially concerning the characters' development. However, the figurations of health and illness are not fixed and, therefore, it is necessary to seek a nucleus of meaning to these notions. We would argue that the fundamental contraposition between these terms is the expression of a tension between the unfolding of life with its normal expectations and a disruptive force that shakes this structure. It is a question of developing the terms of this contraposition, exploring some images of Mann's novels, from which we can expose the critical dimension of illness as a philosophical concept. Then, we will present a few moments of Mann's Doctor Faust, in order to explore the critical structure of this notion and the way it operates. Finally, we will take music, one of the central themes of Mann's novel, as a model for the analysis of this possible criticism. Based on that, we can present the limits of this conception of illness as a critical device, especially within the artistic debate of the twentieth century. © 2018 Universidade de Minas Gerais.

ABSTRACT: In 1964 the Italian avant-garde musician Franco Evangelisti decided to cease to compose. The radical decision to give up to write music was not meant to interrupt his musical activity. In the same year he founded the Gruppo d'lmprovvlsazione Nuova Consonanza with other artists as Larry Austin, John Heinemann and Ennio Morricone. Giving up traditional composition was just one of several shifts in his artistic biography. In fact the evolution of his oeuvre can be summarized in the following steps: From serial composition to aleatory techniques, from a musique Informelle to the implementation of collective works, and finally from the strictliy organized musical improvisation to the writing down a book about the end of music. The binding moment of the entire evolution of Evangelisti's artistic and intellectual production lies in the constant discomfort with the notion of musical work both in terms of tradition and in the sense of the aesthetics of the post-war avant-garde. This paper explores the different strategies Implemented by Evangelisti in order to break up with every single aspect of tradition starting from serial composition and ending with the draft of his book. © 2018 Laaber-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: A core design feature of human communication systems and expressive behaviours is their temporal organization. The cultural evolutionary origins of this feature remain unclear. Here, we test the hypothesis that regularities in the temporal organization of signalling sequences arise in the course of cultural transmission as adaptations to aspects of cortical function.We conducted two experiments on the transmission of rhythms associated with affective meanings, focusing on one of the most widespread forms of regularity in language and music: isochronicity. In the first experiment, we investigated how isochronous rhythmic regularities emerge and change in multigenerational signalling games, where the receiver (learner) in a game becomes the sender (transmitter) in the next game.We show that signalling sequences tend to become rhythmically more isochronous as they are transmitted across generations. In the second experiment, we combined electroencephalography (EEG) and two-player signalling games over 2 successive days.We show that rhythmic regularization of sequences can be predicted based on the latencies of the mismatch negativity response in a temporal oddball paradigm. These results suggest that forms of isochronicity in communication systems originate in neural constraints on information processing, which may be expressed and amplified in the course of cultural transmission. © The Author(s) (2018).

ABSTRACT: The design of tall architectures building assumed for modern architects a particular compositive challenges: not only following the new technical potentiality derived from innovative materials for construction (i.e. Iron, steel, reinforced concrete etc.), but also evocating different essential symbols through monolithic shapes. Some recent building sites in Milan offer the opportunity to focus the attention on some evidences in the evolution of design techniques toward the composition of these buildings, in comparison between the XX century analogue orthogonal drafting machine and the actual complex digital 3D (/4D) tools. These two drawing techniques could be considered as the output devices of different algorithms approaching the same gravity challenge to which any architecture design must afford. The verticality of the building structures allows the overlapping of the horizontal floors following the static sciences: the construction and available materials technique could obtain different solutions essentially in reason of calculation process and aesthetical approaches defined by design concept and drawing procedures. © 2018 Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava.

ABSTRACT: Harmony search algorithm is an emerging meta-heuristic optimization algorithm, which is inspired by the music improvisation process and can solve different optimization problems. In order to further improve the performance of the algorithm, this paper proposes an improved harmony search algorithm. Key parameters including harmonic memory consideration (HMCR), pitch adjustment rate (PAR), and bandwidth (BW) are optimized as the number of iterations increases. Meanwhile, referring to the genetic algorithm, an improved method to generate a new crossover solutions rather than the traditional mechanism of improvisation. Four complex function optimization and pressure vessel optimization problems were simulated using the optimization algorithm of standard harmony search algorithm, improved harmony search algorithm and exploratory harmony search algorithm. The simulation results show that the algorithm improves the ability to find global search and evolutionary speed. Optimization effect simulation results are satisfactory. © 2018 KIPS.

ABSTRACT: The cultural industries offer a case study of the impact on the market of the breach of a partially enforceable legal right. The legal entitlement linked to information in the form of intellectual property has become fuzzier with the digitization of information goods, i.e. the evolution from analog to digital media, and the widespread sharing of information in the Internet. This process has had a major impact in the copyright industries, namely the cultural industries. The correlation between plummeting sales in recorded music and Internet file-sharing epitomizes the main argument used by the copyright industries, which have taken it in the past as a case in favor of stricter legislation aimed at curbing the widespread infringement of intellectual property rights. In parallel, developments in a variety of business models have taken place as an alternative way of dealing with the new environment (see Bourreau, Gensollen & Moreau, 2012). © 2018 selection and editorial matter.

ABSTRACT: Musicotherapy is frequently used with children suffering from autistic disorders given their strong interest in the sound object. We propose in this paper to study the features of this mediation from the point of view of psychoanalytical theory. In this perspective, we expose and analyse «step by step» the trajectory and the evolution of an autistic child, Harpocrate, in a musicotherapy setting during one year. It appears that the integration of maternal and paternal functions are complementary during the symbolization processes emerging from the encounter with sound and intersubjectivity. The evolution of this child helps to understand the symboligenic aspects of sound mediation allowing him to explore his inner experience and gradually bring him into the language. © 2018 Editions Medecine et Hygiene.

ABSTRACT: Art is expressed in multiple formats in today's human cultures. Physical traces of stone tools and other archaeological landmarks suggest early nonart cultural behavior and symbolic cognition in the early Homo sapiens (HS) who emerged ~ 300,000–200,000 years ago in Africa. Fundamental to art expression is the neural underpinning for symbolic cognition, and material art is considered its prime example. However, prior to producing material art, HS could have exploited symbolically through art-rooted biological neural pathways for social purpose, namely, those controlling interpersonal motoric coordination and sound codependence. Aesthetics would not have been the primary purpose; arguments for group dance and rhythmical musical sounds are offered here. In addition, triggers for symbolic body painting are discussed. These cultural art formats could well have preceded material art and would have enhanced unity, inclusiveness, and cooperative behavior, contributing significantly to already existing nonart cultural practices. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The paper is devoted to a topical subject for contemporary religious studies - sacralisation of the profane, particularly manifested in the sacralization of popular culture products. These processes can be described as religion-like phenomena, and their understanding is important for the adequate perception of the Western religion of the XXI century. The purpose of this paper is to present possible interpretations of the religion-like phenomena proposed in contemporary religious studies, so the objects included considering concepts that describe the peculiarities and key features of contemporary Western religiosity and the debate about secularization and post-secularism, as well as analyzing the main methodological approaches to the religion-like phenomena study. The paper shows that some of these approaches remain within the framework of theology, while others are methodologically based on postmodern philosophy or cognitive studies and evolutionary psychology. It is proposed that although cognitive methodology is well applicable to the study of religion-like phenomena, a complete rejection of its functionalist interpretation appears to be wrong as religion-like phenomena perform a number of important functions generally inherent of religion. The conclusions are supported by illustrative material first of all provided by musical variants of religion-like phenomena as they appear to illustrate most clearly the features of such phenomena. A cognitive theory of narrative proposed by L. Rue turns out to be productive when analyzing music religion-like phenomena along with various psychological concepts, exploring the celebrities worship syndrome (CWS), as well as purely physiological approaches, based on studying the effects of music on hormones production and the impact of the latter on individuals and groups. © 2018 Saint Petersburg State University.

ABSTRACT: From the first wax cylinders through to digital downloads, from network output captured on crystal sets through to Digital Audio Broadcasting, audio listeners have consumed culture entirely mediated by technology. These audiences have enjoyed music on vinyl records, transistor radios, or iPods, and in so doing have determined the evolution of music, sharing and propagating its popularity. Audiences, however, have also used their audio technology to listen to the spoken word. Early broadcasters realised the potential of radio technology to disseminate news and sports for its listeners to consume in immediacy and simultaneity. The pleasures of radio would subsequently encompass book readings, which would evolve into ‘drama.’ Although it is one of the most neglected fields of performance culture, throughout its history audio drama has been prolific and impactful. Early in the advent of broadcasting, radio drama proved itself to be enormously flexible, creating different formats of drama, from serialisations to standalone works, as well as inventing genres such as the soap opera and developing distinctive forums for science fiction, fantasy, whodunits, and other popular narratives. In the twentieth century, radio featured adaptations of fiction which were as (in)famous as Mercury Theatre on the Air’s “War of the Worlds” broadcast (1938) and as monumental as the BBC’s adaptation of the complete Sherlock Holmes (1989-98). In the twenty-first century, the internet has created a new era of audio drama: there has never been a more fluid range of options through which we can consume network or independent radio, and, in addition to this, there are websites streaming archival materials as well as podcasts of experimental or amateur work. In short, with a plethora of available works from past and present, there has never been a richer time to be a ‘listener.'. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Dennis Cutchins, Katja Krebs, Eckart Voigts; individual chapters, the contributors.

ABSTRACT: Animals seem to be everywhere in contemporary literature, visual art, and performance. But though writers, artists, and performers are now engaging more and more with ideas about animals, and even with actual living animals, their aesthetic practice continues to be interpreted within a primarily human frame of reference-with art itself being understood as an exclusively human endeavor. The critical wager in this book is that the aesthetic impulse itself is profoundly trans-species. Rohman suggests that if we understand artistic and performative impulses themselves as part of our evolutionary inheritance-as that which we borrow, in some sense, from animals and the natural world-the ways we experience, theorize, and value literary, visual, and performance art fundamentally shift. Although other arguments suggest that certain modes of aesthetic expression are closely linked to animality, Rohman argues that the aesthetic is animal, showing how animality and actual animals are at the center of the aesthetic practices of crucial modernist, contemporary, and avant-garde artists. Exploring the implications of the shift from an anthropocentric to a bioaesthetic conception of art, this book turns toward animals as artistic progenitors in a range of case studies that spans print texts, visual art, dance, music, and theatrical performance. Drawing on the ideas of theorists such as Elizabeth Grosz, Jane Bennett, Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, Jacques Derrida, Una Chaudhuri, Timothy Morton, and Cary Wolfe, Rohman articulates a deep coincidence of the human and animal elaboration of life forces in aesthetic practices. © Oxford University Press 2018.

ABSTRACT: Using Grime as a case study, I employ the analytical framework I created, that is, Musicological Discourse Analysis (MDA) as a holistic mode of analysis to contextualize Grime sociologically and musicologically. This method retheorizes genre, providing a more specific, useful, and detailed musical classification system; the sonic footprint timestamp (SFT). The MDA framework provides a generic mode of musical analysis for research projects in sociology, cultural studies, and the social sciences fields. This article evaluates key musical influences in the evolution of Grime as both (i) a musical form and (ii) an analysis of influences in relation to its social context. It evaluates the global, local, historical, technological, political, lyrical themes, and sonic properties (sounds) found in Grime. Significantly, this framework is very much concerned with the voices in the Grime scene, and therefore respondent experiences are central to this analytical method—incorporating in-depth interviews, observation (physical and online), and immersive listening. © The Author(s) 2018.

ABSTRACT: This paper describes an approach that combines generative adversarial networks (GANs) with interactive evolutionary computation (IEC). While GANs can be trained to produce lifelike images, they are normally sampled randomly from the learned distribution, providing limited control over the resulting output. On the other hand, interactive evolution has shown promise in creating various artifacts such as images, music and 3D objects, but traditionally relies on a hand-designed evolvable representation of the target domain. The main insight in this paper is that a GAN trained on a specific target domain can act as a compact and robust genotype-to-phenotype mapping (i.e. most produced phenotypes do resemble valid domain artifacts). Once such a GAN is trained, the latent vector given as input to the GAN’s generator network can be put under evolutionary control, allowing controllable and high-quality image generation. In this paper, we demonstrate the advantage of this novel approach through a user study in which participants were able to evolve images that strongly resemble specific target images. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

ABSTRACT: For musicians, learning to improvise requires individual and collaborative skill and knowledge that in experts is acquired over years of immersion and enculturation. Learning formally, informally or a combination of both, improvisers ‘learn to learn’ by evolving meta-cognitive capabilities necessary to develop and refine improvisational expertise. This qualitative study explores the learning of musical knowledge across the lifespan by five prominent Australian improvising musicians. Using the conceptual lenses of practice, community and identity, this study investigates formal and informal ways of acquiring skill and knowledge, and the ways interpersonal and collaborative activity shape metacognitive processes, beliefs and understandings of improvised music making. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis is used to examine the understandings of how expert improvisers think about the ways they acquire knowledge, skills, and negotiate within shared, situated learning environments. Findings suggest informal approaches to skill development and experiences engage processes that lead to independent, co-operative and collaborative expertise. This study informs educators who work with young musicians about expert improvisers’ experiential formal and informal learning, critical thinking, and evolution of creative and metacognitive processes. A model of formal and informal learning traits in improvisation/jazz education informs educators in developing formalised informal learning, and nuanced aspects of optimising meaningful educational practice in improvisation. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: This paper analyzes the hierarchical microstructure of cold-drawn pearlitic steels. To this end, environmentally assisted fracture behavior and microstructural integrity in aggressive environments is analyzed in progressively cold-drawn pearlitic steels based on their microstructural evolution during the multi-step cold drawing manufacture process producing a slenderizing and orientation of the pearlitic colonies (first microstructural level), and orientation and densification of the ferrite/cementite lamellae (second microstructural level). Thus the microstructure of the cold-drawn pearlitic steel wires becomes progressively oriented as the cold-drawing degree increases and this microstructural fact affects their macroscopic behavior, inducing anisotropic fracture behavior and crack path deflection in aggressive environments. In addition, the hierarchical microstructure of cold-drawn pearlitic steel wires in two microstructural levels (colonies and lamellae) suggests a consideration of them as hierarchically structured materials (HSM). Furthermore, an analogy is established in the paper between the microstructural arrangement in cold-drawn pearlitic steels and the multi-level structure of Johann Sebastian Bach’s music. © 2018 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

ABSTRACT: Equalizers play an essential role in processing and enhancement of quality of audio signals apart from their conventional utilizations to flatten out undesirable harmonics from telephone signals, music, etc. In recent times, research in different variants of equalizers has seen a great increase with optimization algorithms trying to provide maximum gain with least interference between adjacent frequency bands. This research paper proposes a 16-order IIR bi-quad filter optimized with evolutionary algorithm in the form of genetic crossover and mutation to provide maximum gain. The magnitude, frequency response and group delay characteristics obtained from the proposed algorithm have been tested and analyzed by comparing with existing conventional Nth-order IIR implementations without optimization and superior performance observed. It could be seen that that peak error oscillates between ± 1.9 dB for hundredfold increase in order of filters with a maximum limit set at 750. Computational complexity is observed to be reduced as the proposed algorithm searches the sample space for the best order suitable for the given target output in the least time possible. The experimentations have been implemented in MATLAB and SNRs measured as performance metric. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: A unique branch of vocal performance is formed by specimens of the "wordless" vocalise - a musical gerne formed in the countries of Western Europe and in Russia towards the mid-18th century. Situated beyond the perimeter of musicological thought, it nonetheless conceals numerous riddles. The latter include the structural and sematic organization of its two varieties: the instructive and the concert vocalises. Pertaining to one category, they remain individualized in their means of presentation and the specificity of their performance and, consequently, in the tasks which are set before the vocalist. Their expressive potential is formed in the process of interaction of musical and non-musical components, which require thorough attention. A separate problem is posed by the study of the genesis and historical evolution of the gerne in the direction from applied specimens (the instructive vocalise) to artistic examples (the concert vocalise). The specificity of the vocal melody in vocalises is revealed through the prism of interaction between the acoustic, technical and expressive characteristic features of the singer's voice performing and the vocal "orphoepy." A typical feature for vocalises pertaining to the Russian and Western European vocal schools is its melismatically melodic thematicism. It is examined in the article in close connection with the varied forms of vocal and instrumental practice of music-making. © 2018 Ufa State Institute of Arts. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: In this article there will be developed a discussion about some of the main aspects of the functioning of the acoustic guitars, beginning with a brief history putting in context the changes the instrument has been through the centuries, including some notes made by the physicist Michael Kasha. Emphasis will be placed on the description of the guitar bracing, a set of bars and tone braces that have acoustic and structural purposes and that presented an evolution in form and complexity that accompanied the development of the guitar. A mathematical treatment is made of the Helmholtz resonator formed by the air enclosed by the instrument's body. Finally, a discussion is developed about magnetic pickups, which were introduced in the first half of the 20th century to the guitars, with the objective to obtain a higher sound intensity level and later led to the emerging of solid body instruments such as the electric guitar and the electric bass.

ABSTRACT: The Practice of the Self situates the work of American poet Charles Olson (1910–70) at the centre of the early postwar American avant-garde. It shows Olson to have been one of the major advocates and theorists of American modernism in the late 1940s and early 1950s; a poet who responded fully and variously to the political, ethical, and aesthetic urgencies driving innovation across contemporary American art. Reading Olson’s work alongside that of contemporaries associated with the New York Schools of painting and music (as well as the exiled Frankfurt School), the book draws on Olson’s published and unpublished writings to establish an original account of early postwar American modernism. The development of Olson’s work is seen to illustrate two primary drivers of formal innovation in the period: The evolution of a new model of political action pivoting around the radical individual and, relatedly, a powerful new critique of instrumental reason and the Enlightenment tradition. Drawing on extensive archival research and featuring readings of a wide range of artists—including, prominently, Barnett Newman, Mark Rothko, David Smith, Wolfgang Paalen, and John Cage—The Practice of the Self offers a new reading of a major American poet and an original account of the emergence of postwar American modernism. © Mark Byers 2018.

ABSTRACT: The SELFHOOD installation was conceived aiming to instigate a reflection on the self through a practical and interactive experience. A representation of each participant is created in a form of a cloud of points and a sound drone, suggesting their selves. The dynamics of the visitors’ movements is sonified in such way that colours and sound textures are fused in a surrounding hexaphonic system. CromaCrono≈, the system for immersive improvisation that produces digitally synthesized sounds in real time, is described. Philosophical concepts concerning notions of the Self are presented. We propose that the notion of Presence can be induced by virtual and/or physical sources of stimulation governed by a number of principles that underlie human experience, creativity, and discovery. The methodological point of view is that the notion of Presence indicates that there are essential inputs for the construction of self-referral agents. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

ABSTRACT: All creative activity brings about change, since it results in the production of something that did not previously exist. The act of creation is itself influenced by changes that have been previously brought about by others, including previous acts of creation. As with any human behavior, creativity has both biological and cultural aspects and is therefore influenced by biological as well as cultural evolution. However, biological evolution operates slowly and over a much longer timescale than cultural evolution, and change occurring within a human lifetime must be driven by cultural and social, rather than biological processes. In order to examine changes at this timescale, we therefore assume a fixed biological substrate and examine how creativity occurs in a social and cultural context. We argue that a fuller understanding of artistic creativity arises from setting this phenomenon in a wider context that encompasses creativity in both the arts and the sciences. We analyze creativity using the BVSR model developed by Simonton and conclude that creativity is driven by similar mechanisms in both domains. We propose that the arts and the sciences are not qualitatively different intellectual domains but should be conceptualized as activities situated at different regions of a continuum of human endeavor. This suggests that it would be fruitful for both scientists and artists to devote more attention to learning from the achievements of those who generate creative ideas at different points on this continuum. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Purpose: A salesman calls up to offer you a “much” better phone plan. Before you know, you have changed to this new plan, which not only exceeds your needs, but also “procures” a six-month free subscription to an online music service. You needed neither and pay more: you have just been “phished” as Akerlof and Shiller would say in their recent book Phishing for Phools. Furthermore, their phishing equilibrium dictates that if your company does not phish others will, so you phish to survive. The purpose of this paper is to present a formal analysis of phishing and phishing equilibria with surprising potential benefits to consumers rather than scamsters. Design/methodology/approach: The paper provides a conceptual/formal (game theoretical) analysis of phishing in markets. Findings: Being an honest trader may actually, under certain circumstances, be an advantage in a market contrary to Akerlof and Shiller’s thesis Phishing for Phools. Research limitations/implications: Phishing for Phools may have its limitations when viewed from an evolutionary game-theoretical perspective which has positive implications for behavioral finance and significance of a phishing equilibrium in markets populated by honest as well as dishonest traders. Practical implications: The paper shows that Phishing for Phools may not always be a winning strategy contrary to many current business schemes from phone plans to selling pharmaceutical products. Social implications: The paper reveals important differences between honesty, dishonesty, and trust between traders in a market. Originality/value: This paper provides, to the authors’ knowledge, the first in-depth formal and conceptual analyses of phishing and phishing equilibria. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: The internet today has evolved from information superhighway to a household necessity that offers more than just information. Nowadays, the internet serves a lot of purpose. It is a tool for not just information but entertainment that offers music, graphics and videos that is available for downloading or streaming. It has also evolved to be a medium of communication that offers a global link from people around the globe. From emails, short message services and even voice communication, the internet has all of these to offer. The former information superhighway is today a social media platform that is open to all ages to all variety of users. With this development, it is logical to think that the current internet network scheme should also be subjected to evolution. The emerging Information Centric Network is quite a good fit to the future of internet. The idea to be concerned to the content that is to be accessed more than the identity of the one accessing the content is tailor-fit to the current application of internet. In a nutshell, ICN requires node with caching functionality. An effective caching algorithm is a great help to attain the very purpose of ICN which is to come up with an efficient network. Meanwhile, fuzzy logic, which has proven to be effective in control or optimization applications, can also be applied in improving caching functionality of ICN. This paper explores the application of fuzzy logic to the caching algorithm that can be used to further improve current information centric networks. The results were obtained from hypothetical data because this is just to prove that fuzzy logic can be applied in the caching dynamics of Information Centric Network. © 2018 Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka.

ABSTRACT: The word "minimalism" is a word derived from French the word "minimum". Whereas the lexical meaning of minimum is "the least or the smallest quantity necessary for something", its expression in mathematics can be described as "the lowest step a variable number can descend, least, minimal". Minimalism, which advocates an extreme simplicity of the artistic form, is a current in modern art and music whose origins go to 1960s and which features simplicity and objectivity. Although art, science and philosophy are different disciplines, they support each other from time to time, sometimes they intertwine and sometimes they copy each other. A periodic schools or teaching in one of them can take the others into itself, so, they proceed on their ways empowering each other. It is also true for the minimalism in art and the minimal invasive surgical approaches in science. Concepts like doing with less, avoiding unnecessary materials and reducing the number of the elements in order to increase the effect in the expression which are the main elements of the minimalism in art found their equivalents in medicine and neurosurgery. Their equivalents in medicine or neurosurgery have been to protect the physical integrity of the patient with less iatrogenic injury, minimum damage and the same therapeutic effect in the most effective way and to enable the patient to regain his health in the shortest span of time. As an anticipation, we can consider that the minimal approaches started by Richard Wollheim and Barbara Rose in art and Lars Leksell, Gazi Yasargil and other neurosurgeons in neurosurgery in the 1960s are the present day equivalents of the minimalist approaches perhaps unconsciously started by Kazimir Malevich in art and Victor Darwin L'Espinasse in neurosurgery in the early 1900s. We can also consider that they have developed interacting with each other, not by chance. © 2018, Turk Neurosurg.

ABSTRACT: The rationale for this contribution rests on two objectives. The text, which is meant to be expository in nature, is bound to sketch a short history of Australian English against Schneider’s Model of Postcolonial English Evolutionary Scenario, and further on, it aims to depict the status quo of Australian English today as an index for identity construction. And it is also meant to provide the reflective line along with the presentation of relevant aspects in question in terms of the union between spatial and temporal dimensions, thus fulfilling the aspect of English as transported (in its numerous regional and social brands) and transformed into the brand of English in the new territory, also ‘travelling’ and working its way across the landscapes and the history of new discursive formations accompanying the rise of the new Antipodean identity. I trust these two motivations will merge into a single line as the text develops. It is assumed that language is an organic entity that evolves uniquely in the environment of multiple factors, such as climate, landscape, flora and fauna, indigenous populations and language contact situations, political and social contexts, ideologies, technological progress, lifestyles, etc. All of these resting on the dynamism between the external and internal factors, such as the new setting versus the old country, the new setting versus new external influences, etc. The abundance of variables cutting across the geographical spaces and social spaces along with the historical dimension provide the fertile ground for the emergence of unmatched uniqueness, which gains its utmost quality in the realm of multiple semiotic modes, visual art, music, literary expression among others, all resting on social codes whose growth and development deserves a separate treatment, beyond purely linguistic considerations, and yet not divorced from them. This contribution concentrates on language alone. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

ABSTRACT: This article is devoted to the characteristics of "freely-pulsating composition." This technique has been developed in the works of Leif Segerstam - a significant Finnish composer and conductor. Segerstam's creativity astonishes by its extremely prolific quality. The composer wrote more than three hundred symphonies and also numerous compositions in other genres. Such artistically creative activity has been stipulated by those principles of composition which the Finnish composer has developed. Their formation and evolution took up over two decades. The "freely-pulsating phase" was initiated by Segerstam in the mid-1970s, while all the basic features of the composer's technique were formed by the late 1990s. In its final variant, the method of "free pulsation" became connected with the sphere of the symphony: it has been demonstrated by musical compositions written since the early 2000s. These symphonies are essentially one-movement sonoristic compositions, generally, all of them of the same duration and performed without a conductor (in Segerstam's words, they rely on an "built-in conducting mechanism"). Their musical texture is based on an aleatory counterpoint, in which the various instrumental parts are synchronized loosely. The form of symphonies consists of several (from 5 to 8) blocks, in which there is an alternation of more and less controlled sections. In general, the features of "freely-pulsating composition" make it possible to consider it an individual version of aleatory techniques and to see its preimages in the American music from the 1960s, with the works of Earle Brown and Christian Wolff. © 2018 Ufa State Institute of Arts.

ABSTRACT: Introduction: The charm of mobile phone is more among young generation and the increasing use can lead to various harmful effects and may result in dependence. The objective of the study is to evaluate the pattern of mobile phone use among medical students. Methods: A descriptive cross sectional study was conducted on a total of 229 medical students aged between 18 and 25 years who were using mobile phones for more than 1 year by using simple random sampling technique. Students were requested to complete a pre-tested self-administered questionnaire which comprised their socio-demographic characteristics and pattern of mobile phone usage. Results: Among the total 229 students, all of them had their own smart phones. Major purpose of using mobile was for calling, listening music, taking photos/videos and internet use. Most of the students 97 (42.4%) have owned mobile phones since 4-6 years. The median time spent by the students on the mobile phone using different features of mobile phone was 3.5 hours. Majority of the students i.e. 157 (68.5%) use mobile phones at night. The median amount of money spent on recharge per month was 500. Age of student was significantly (P <0.05) associated with calls per day. There was no significant association of pattern of mobile phone use with other selected socio-demographic variables Conclusions: Students were found to use mobile phone excessively. The pattern of mobile phone usage among the students in this study may signal the evolution of mobile phone use from a habit to an addiction. © 2018, Nepal Medical Association.

ABSTRACT: Background: Research regarding students’ ideas about the nature of sound reveals a variety of conceptions about sound. In order to reconstruct these ideas and explain sound phenomena, researchers’ teaching interventions often make use of everyday-life contexts. However existing research on sound only partially addresses the correlation between the properties of sound and its perceptive characteristics. Purpose: To identify the evolution of students’ conceptions regarding the nature of sound and its properties (frequency, intensity and frequency spectrum) through a teaching-learning sequence (TLS) about sound phenomena in an authentic musical context. The described TLS consists of three activities aiming students to correlate the properties of sound waves (frequency, intensity and frequency spectrum) with its perceptive characteristics (pitch, loudness and timbre) via the use of smartphone applications. Sample: Eight students, in the second year of their studies in the Department of Primary Education of the XXX University. Design and methods: Students’ perspectives on sound and their progression are investigated through a teaching experiment design. Data are collected by recording students’ interviews. Due to the explorative nature of the research qualitative methods of content analysis are used. Results: The results show that the students’ perspectives on sound evolved, as students managed to consolidate links between their everyday experience of sounds and the underlying science concepts as frequency, intensity and frequency spectrum. The authentic environment and the use of the smartphone’s applications were key factors for the success of the teaching experiment. The interaction with the activities shifted student’s conceptualizations closer to the scientific ones, by communicating every day sound experiences with their scientific interpretation. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) mainly occurs in elderly individuals. Comorbidities and chronic pain are frequent in this population. Previous studies revealed that personality modulates both chronic pain (CP) andADoccurrence and evolution. Moreover, as pain treatments can induce side-effects, non-drugs treatments, such as art interventions, are interesting alternative therapies for decreasing CP in these patients. Objective: Our aim was to assess the potential role of personality traits on art intervention efficacy for reducing CP in a population of patients with mild AD. Methods: Design: multicenter randomized controlled trial. Fifty mild AD patients underwent a 12-week art intervention including singing and painting groups. Personality was assessed with the Big Five Inventory before the sessions. CP was measured with Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) [Usual pain (NRS-U) and most Intense pain (NRS-I)], Simple Visual Scale [Usual pain (SVS-U) and most Intense pain (SVS-I)] and Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) before and after the sessions. The influence of personality traits on CP evolution before and after art intervention was assessed with multiple linear regression models. Results: A positive association was observed between neuroticism and the evolution of three CP measures including NRS-U (B = 0.34, p = 0.01), SVS-U (B = 0.20, p = 0.04), and BPI-U (B = 0.46, p = 0.02) evolution. No significant relationship was observed between neuroticism and NRS-I, SVS-I and BPI-R evolution. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that neuroticism can decrease the efficacy of group art intervention on pain in patients with mild AD. Individual therapies could be more appropriate for these patients. These results emphasize the interest of taking into account patients' personality before proposing them to participate to a group therapy. © 2018 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Nuyorican poetry is written and/or performed by New York Puerto Rican poets affiliated with or in the tradition of the Nuyorican Poets Cafe, a performance space and cultural center on the Lower East Side of Manhattan founded by Miguel Algarín and others circa 1973. Although heterogeneous in form and content, many Nuyorican poems explore the limits of the page and the performed word, often mixing English and Spanish and animated by an irreverent and decolonial sensibility. Its boundaries are porous, as the earliest Nuyorican poems predate the Nuyorican Poets Cafe, and as it has influenced a range of contemporary performance-oriented poetics (such as slam poetry). Nuyorican poems and poets were central to the Puerto Rican Movement of the 1960s and 1970s and to the formation and evolution of Latina/o studies. More recently, they have been crucial to the emergence of diaspora and Afro-latinidad as key terms in Latina/o studies through the widely influential work of the late Juan Flores: a poem such as Felipe Luciano’s influential “Jibaro/My Pretty Nigger” (1968) spans these contexts, having been performed in the film Right On! The Original Last Poets (1970) and on Eddie Palmieri’s Live at Sing Sing album (1972) and excerpted in Flores and Miriam Jiménez Román’s The Afro-Latin@ Reader (2010). Ultimately, the history and legacy of Nuyorican poetry also involve poetry’s intimate relationship to music, theater, visual art, fiction, and other expressive cultural forms in mapping the complex and evolving spatial politics of the Puerto Rican diaspora. In essays such as “Nuyorican Literature” (1981) and in his introduction to the foundational Nuyorican Poetry: An Anthology of Puerto Rican Words and Feelings (1975), coedited with Miguel Piñero, Algarín develops a sophisticated poetics and cultural politics of survival and struggle, of a community’s evolution and its modes of resistance and healing. Algarín argues for a poetics that can “verbalize the stresses of street experience” (“Introduction” 14), documenting urban struggle in a way that creates a new reality instead of simply reflecting the current one, as is the case with the term “Nuyorican,” which was used pejoratively on the island of Puerto Rico to refer to the supposed inauthenticity of New York Puerto Ricans, but which is reclaimed by Algarín, Piñero, and their peers in an act of poetic and political revisionism (Hernandez 39-40). © Cambridge University Press 2018.

ABSTRACT: Darwinian evolution is reconsidered from a microscopic perspective commensurate with modern advanced molecular readings of our physical world and its mathematical structure. Fundamental biological processes in physical Complex Enough Systems, CES, are defined and analyzed. The material description contrives molecular events at precise temperatures and specific timescales reflecting a fundamental spatiotemporal character of a conceptual class of Correlated Dissipative Structures, CDS. The latter is subject to a higher-order statistical ensemble, the Correlated Dissipative Ensemble, CDE, reminding of Dawkins' notion of an evolution of evolvability. The ontological question is reviewed incorporating the material and the immaterial parts of Nature. The exposition integrates well-defined teleonomic processes, objectively governed by an evolved program, leading up to a self-referential hypothesis for molecular communication, Communication Simpliciter. The principal unit of selection is intrinsic to the molecular genetic level and proceeds toward an extended phenotype that implicates perception and cognition. It is explicitly proven that active and mirror neurons provide communication protocols for cellular recognition and networking. The paradox of upside-down vision is explained together with a basic and straightforward analysis of the Necker Cube and the Spinning Dancer illusions. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: This paper concentrates on the presentation of a California Bay Area Jungian focused study group for the 50 Anniversary of the American Dance Therapy Association Annual Conference. Examining the evolution of Jung’s basic psychoanalytic perceptions over the years, this panel of presenters offered an in-depth study of related topics via lecture in the morning and its amplification via authentic movement in the service of dance/movement therapy in the afternoon. The latter included embodying and transforming remnants of participants’ morning reflections, channeled via authentic movement (AM). Panelist took turns leading an AM experience related to her morning’s topic and concluding by pairing or grouping participants to demonstrate and relate his/her personal journey. The final presenter initiated a process of transcendence in which the parts are amplified into choreography. Our panelists demonstrated a clinical approach to healing in which authentic movement stokes active imagination, elevating unconscious problematic issues to conscious awareness. Overtly expressed in choreographic form, such revelations can enable integrated therapeutic closure to group dance/movement therapy sessions. © 2018, American Dance Therapy Association.

ABSTRACT: Background. Forrest-Blincoe is a 4th dan black belt master in Tang Soo Do which he has studied in the United States and Korea. He has also studied Taekkyon in South Korea.1 During this time, he has been interested in the official histories of these martial arts in contrast with documented histories (which often differ significantly). Both Forrest and Forrest-Blincoe are trained anthropologists. Forrest specializes in symbols and national identity, and has published extensively on the anthropology of movement and dance. Problem and Aim. The martial arts Taekwondo, Tang Soo Do, and Taekkyon have competed within Korea for some time to represent Korean culture, and Korea has used martial arts as an export as one component in its drive to gain legitimacy as a world power competitive with its more powerful neighbors of China and Japan. This paper examines the process of using martial arts as symbols of Korean national identity. Methods. The authors use both analysis of historical texts and anthropological fieldwork. Available sources are explored in as much detail as possible (especially linguistic), challenging several common beliefs about the martial arts' origins and evolution. Results. Historical sources paint a murky picture of the history of Korean martial arts, obscured by early practitioners, and not completely understood by recent scholars. Conclusions. This paper goes beyond showing that Korean martial arts have roots in China and Japan (which is generally acknowledged), to emphasize that they have become distinctively Korean over time, evolving in their own special ways in Korea, and, thus, becoming legitimate exports as symbols of Korean national identity and individuality. © Idōkan Poland Association.

ABSTRACT: Bourne’s chapter presents an overview of the early Eurocentric representation of black people from the African diaspora in ballet. She then explores how these representations continue to negatively impact the career prospects of black British ballet dancers today. By following these dancers’ progression towards acceptance and integration into British ballet institutions (from the 1970s onwards), Bourne examines the extent to which the negative stereotypes associated with black African people have limited their inclusion in British ballet. The chapter also highlights the role that key individuals have played in promoting the inclusion of black dancers and black dance forms in classical ballet. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2018.

ABSTRACT: This paper engages the “culture gap” in the sustainable tourism literature by addressing issues of cultural sustainability through an investigation of traditional festivals in Bhutan. Cultural sightseeing is the major motivation for tourism to Bhutan, and religious festivals are among the primary contexts within which local people and tourists interact. Tourism brings forces of modernization and globalization into contact with traditional practices, with various consequences. Based primarily on on-site observation of religious festivals, and interviews with Bhutanese monks and abbots, this paper explores the incursion of modernization into traditional festivals. Bauman's concept of "liquid modernity" is applied to articulate the intertwining of traditional and modern practices and frames of reference in constantly changing ways. This leads to a critical discussion of how the case of Bhutan’s festivals reveals the necessity of seeing cultural sustainability in fluid and evolutionary terms, especially in our “liquid modern” times. Foreign tourists and local youth are identified as particular agents of liquid modernism in the religious festivals, bringing perspectives and behaviors that diverge from those of the traditional society within which the meaning and practices of these festivals are rooted, which in turn affects the performance and performers of the dances. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Anchialine caves have revealed a variety of highly adapted animals including several records of nerillid annelids. However, only one stygobitic lineage, Speleonerilla nom. nov. (previously known as Longipalpa), seems obligate to this environment. We here provide new information on this lineage including the description of three new species, two new records, and the first phylogeny of the genus. All species have been collected from the water column of anchialine caves in the Caribbean, Bermuda, and Canary Islands, contrary to their benthic and interstitial nerillid relatives. New species were described combining light, scanning electron, and confocal laser scanning microscopy and named after traditional dances from their corresponding countries. Speleonerilla isa sp. n. is morphologically the most divergent species, characterized by the presence of nine segments, two pairs of spermioducts, and parapodial cirri present on all segments. Speleonerilla calypso sp. n. and S. salsa sp. n. are mainly distinguished from S. saltatrix by the presence of one additional pair of nephridia and are diagnosed based on unique combinations of characters including the specific arrangements of trunk ciliation, parapodial cirri, and number of chaetae. Two additional records from anchialine caves in Northeast Cuba and México were not described due to limited available material. Phylogenetic analyses of four molecular markers recovered the East Atlantic S. isa as sister to a clade containing the West Atlantic species, the interrelationship of which did not further reflect the geographical distances within the Caribbean. Evolutionary adaptations are discussed, such as the long ciliated palps and pygidial lobes of Speleonerilla used for swimming and their high tolerance to changing salinities when apparently feeding on bacteria in the halocline of the anchialine cave systems. © 2018, Senckenberg Gesellschaft für Naturforschung and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: In this chapter, we propose a novel approach in which a system autonomously composes dance sequences from previously taught dance moves with the help of the well-known differential evolution algorithm. In this chapter, we propose a novel approach in which a system autonomously composes dance sequences from previously taught dance moves with the help of the well-known differential evolution algorithm. Initially, we generated a large population of dance sequences. The fitness of each of these sequences was determined by calculating the total inter-move transition abruptness of the adjacent dance moves. The transition abruptness was calculated as the difference of corresponding slopes formed by connected body joint co-ordinates. By visually evaluating the dance sequences created, it was observed that the fittest dance sequence had the least abrupt inter-move transitions. Computer simulation undertaken revealed that the developed dance video frames do not have significant inter-move transition abruptness between two successive frames, indicating the efficacy of the proposed approach. Gestural data specific of dance moves is captured using a Microsoft Kinect sensor. The algorithm developed by us was used to fuse the dancing styles of various ‘Odissi’ dancers dancing to the same rasa (theme) and tala (beats) and loy (rhythm). In future, it may be used to fuse different forms of dance. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.

ABSTRACT: For decades Hip Hop cultural practices have been disparaged for allegedly inciting and being responsible for the eruption of urban violence. This assumption, likely built upon pre-existing biases regarding the street culture and ethnic minorities where Hip Hop emerged, ignored how some of the genre’s main elements–particularly freestyle rap, breakin’ or breakdancing and graffiti tagging–initially served the purpose of providing at-risk youths with real alternatives to direct physical violence in their day-to-day lives, and continue do so today. It has also ignored broader analogies with other cross-cultural and cross-species manifestations of similar practices that have served for millennia as effective mechanisms for reducing the likelihood of potentially lethal violence. By presenting these manifestations–namely song dueling and mark making–in comparative terms with Hip Hop’s freestyle song and dance battles and tagging territorial contests, this article seeks to highlight the relevance and potential of Hip Hop for preventing violence while also suggesting a common evolutionary backdrop within the context of strategies aimed at minimizing intraspecific aggression. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Child sexual abuse (CSA) has adverse effects on both the child and the community. While many therapists know of these effects through working with survivors, therapy can and should also be used as a primary prevention tool. Looking at the evolution of CSA prevention efforts, one can see that the field has begun to recognize the importance of community involvement as well as experiential learning. Dance/movement therapy (DMT) may provide the next horizon for addressing these aspects of prevention by building both individual and community resilience through movement and the body. This paper proposes a DMT CSA prevention program centered around three skill-building areas: body awareness, boundary awareness, and communication. Through work within these areas a dance/movement therapist can help individuals and communities begin to integrate their own body awareness with the goals of CSA prevention programs in a way that more fully addresses both the whole person and the whole picture of CSA. © 2018, American Dance Therapy Association.

ABSTRACT: We studied social decision-making in the rule-based improvisational dance There Might Be Others, where dancers make in-the-moment compositional choices. Rehearsals provided a natural test-bed with communication restricted to non-verbal cues. We observed a key artistic explore–exploit tension in which the dancers switched between exploitation of existing artistic opportunities and riskier exploration of new ones. We investigated how the rules influenced the dynamics using rehearsals together with a model generalized from evolutionary dynamics. We tuned the rules to heighten the tension and modelled nonlinear fitness and feedback dynamics for mutation rate to capture the observed temporal phasing of the dancers' exploration-versus-exploitation. Using bifurcation analysis, we identified key controls of the tension and showed how they could shape the decision-making dynamics of the model much like turning a ‘dial’ in the instructions to the dancers could shape the dance. The investigation became an integral part of the development of the dance. © 2018, © 2018 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining Published by Taylor & Francis on behalf of the Institute.

ABSTRACT: This paper aims to explore how the transmission of intangible cultural heritage contributes to the identity of a community through Saja Noreum, a folk play which has been re-created at Abai Village, Cheongho-dong, Sokcho. The play embraces the memories of the villagers' hometown, Bukcheong, in North Korea, the Korean War, the national division and the loss of their home. People of the diaspora identify themselves as the 'Sokcho people from Bukcheong'. This is also manifested in their changing the name of the play from Sokcho Bukcheong Saja Noreum to Sokcho Saja Noreum. This transition is analysed in terms of some of the main factors of intangible cultural heritage: self-identification, constant re-creation as a response to the historical and social evolution of the community and groups concerned, the connection of heritage to the identity of its creators and bearers, the authenticity of the heritage, and the interrelationship between intangible cultural heritage and human rights. Saja Noreum is a living expression and an important link between South and North Korea. © 2016 National Folk Museum of Korea. All Rights Reserved.

ABSTRACT: Existing evolutionary approaches to automatic composition generate only a few melodies in a certain style that is specified by the setting of parameters or the design of fitness functions. Thus, their composition results cannot cover the various tastes of music. In addition, they are not able to deal with the multidimensional nature of music. This paper presents a novel multi-objective evolutionary approach to automatic melody composition in order to produce a variety of melodies at once. To this end, two conflicting fitness measures are investigated to evaluate the fitness of melody; (1) stability and (2) tension. Resorting to music theory, genetic operators (i.e., crossover and mutation) are newly designed to improve search capability in the multi-objective fitness space of music composition. The experimental results demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Moreover, the analysis of composition results proves that the proposed approach generates a set of pleasant and diverse melodies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Dancers are human Expressive Motion experts and could theoretically help robots communicate their state to people, e.g., rushed, confused, curious. The problem is twofold: first, dancers are trained in human-motion whereas many robots are non-Anthropomorphic, and second, most dancers are not programmers. This is where the present interface is useful: The robot demos a batch of motions, in person, and the dancer, who knows expressive motion when she sees it, rates each path's success at communicating a particular state. Using an evolutionary algorithm, the interface-where feedback is recorded on the robot's screen and motion is demonstrated via the robot-calculates a new batch of motions that explore variations of the top-rated paths from the previous generation. This approach addresses the challenges of visualizing the expressive potential of non-Anthropomorphic robots, while also ensuring path characteristics are reproducible via the robot's motion controller. The purpose of the interface is to help a non-expert negotiate a high-dimensional space of robot motion expression. Thus, it also has interactive functionality enabling users to freeze a feature value they like, or reset all features to begin again. To illustrate the system, this paper includes the results of two dancers designing motions for an omni-directional mobile robot, showing convergence with every generation. In reality, motion designers may have many authoring styles-exploring multiple solutions before honing in, or being satisfied easily versus getting each detail exactly right. By combining human-in-The-loop machine learning with direct authoring, we create a kinetic conversation between the robot and the dancer, and gain the ability to model knowledge from complementary fields. © 2017 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: This paper describes the MetaCompose music generator, a compositional, extensible framework for affective music composition. In this context ‘affective’ refers to the music generator’s ability to express emotional information. The main purpose of MetaCompose is to create music in real-time that can express different mood-states, which we achieve through a unique combination of a graph traversal-based chord sequence generator, a search-based melody generator, a pattern-based accompaniment generator, and a theory for mood expression. Melody generation uses a novel evolutionary technique combining FI-2POP with multi-objective optimization. This allows us to explore a Pareto front of diverse solutions that are creatively equivalent under the terms of a multi-criteria objective function. Two quantitative user studies were performed to evaluate the system: one focusing on the music generation technique, and the other that explores valence expression, via the introduction of dissonances. The results of these studies demonstrate (i) that each part of the generation system improves the perceived quality of the music produced, and (ii) how valence expression via dissonance produces the perceived affective state. This system, which can reliably generate affect-expressive music, can subsequently be integrated in any kind of interactive application (e.g., games) to create an adaptive and dynamic soundtrack. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

ABSTRACT: Music similarity is a complex concept that manifests itself in areas such as Music Information Retrieval (MIR), musicological analysis and music cognition. Modelling the similarity of two music items is key for a number of music-related applications, such as cover song detection and query-by-humming. Typically, similarity models are based on intuition, heuristics or small-scale cognitive experiments; thus, applicability to broader contexts cannot be guaranteed. We argue that data-driven tools and analysis methods, applied to songs known to be related, can potentially provide us with information regarding the fine-grained nature of music similarity. Interestingly, music and biological sequences share a number of parallel concepts; from the natural sequence-representation, to their mechanisms of generating variations, i.e., oral transmission and evolution respectively. As such, there is a great potential for applying scientific methods and tools from bioinformatics to music. Stripped-down from biological heuristics, certain bioinformatics approaches can be generalized to any type of sequence. Consequently, reliable and unbiased data-driven solutions to problems such as biological sequence similarity and conservation analysis can be applied to music similarity and stability analysis. Our paper relies on such an approach to tackle a number of tasks and more notably to model global melodic similarity. © 2017 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: This historical reminiscence details the evolution of a type of electronic music called "computer network music." Early computer network music had a heterogeneous quality, with independent composers forming a collective; over time, it has transitioned into the more autonomous form of university-centered "laptop orchestra." This transition points to a fundamental shift in the cultural contexts in which this artistic practice was and is embedded: The early work derived from the post-hippie, neo-punk anarchism of cooperatives whose members dreamed that machines would enable a kind of utopia. The latter is a direct outgrowth of the potential inherent in what networks actually are and of a sense of social cohesion based on uniformity and standardization. The discovery that this style of computer music-making can be effectively used as a curricular tool has also deeply affected the evolution and approaches of many in the field. © 2017 ISAST.

ABSTRACT: Using Robin Dunbar's theories about hominin social bonding and the evolution of music, dance and religion, this article argues that a proto-ritualistic collective song and dance performance established conditions that were ideal for the evolution of fundamental elements of human cognition, such as shared intentionality, joint attention, and the ability to form a mental template. Furthermore, it is argued that this dance routine would have been an effective breeding ground for the development of a psychological regulatory system that could powerfully enforce cooperation by collectively targeting individuals who do not or cannot conform to the melody or the beat - i.e. misfits who do not achieve synchrony with the other members of the dance group. Thus a hominin society consisting of highly cooperative individuals possessing the cognitive skills of shared intentionality, joint attention, and the ability to form mental templates - i.e. a society with all the necessary skills for the development of a mimetic form of communication, followed much later by spoken language - comes into being. © The Author.

ABSTRACT: The article analyzes how action films use different emotional sources of arousal to create narrative tension and suspense in the PECMA flow (i.e., the mental flow of perceptions that activate emotions, cognition, and action). It analyzes how different emotions link to each other or contrast each other in the narrative flow that one metaphorically might call an emotion symphony. The flow may create a time-out experience because of the way in which the action-oriented flow recruits consciousness in full, similar to the way in which music creates flow experiences, as discussed by cognitive music aestheticians. The article discusses how the flow supports character simulation and how it uses a small set of scenarios (HTTOFF scenarios) to drive the flow. To illustrate the symphonic flow, it makes a close reading of John McTiernan's Die Hard (1988). © Berghahn Books.

ABSTRACT: While acquiring motor skills, animals transform their plastic motor sequences to match desired targets. However, because both the structure and temporal position of individual gestures are adjustable, the number of possible motor transformations increases exponentially with sequence length. Identifying the optimal transformation towards a given target is therefore a computationally intractable problem. Here we show an evolutionary workaround for reducing the computational complexity of song learning in zebra finches. We prompt juveniles to modify syllable phonology and sequence in a learned song to match a newly introduced target song. Surprisingly, juveniles match each syllable to the most spectrally similar sound in the target, regardless of its temporal position, resulting in unnecessary sequence errors, that they later try to correct. Thus, zebra finches prioritize efficient learning of syllable vocabulary, at the cost of inefficient syntax learning. This strategy provides a non-optimal but computationally manageable solution to the task of vocal sequence learning. © 2017 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The Darwinian protolanguage hypothesis is one of the most popular theories of the evolution of human language. According to this hypothesis, language evolved through a three stage process involving general increases in intelligence, the emergence of grammatical structure as a result of sexual selection on protomusical songs, and finally the attachment of meaning to the components of those songs. The strongest evidence for the second stage of this process has been considered to be birdsong, and as a result researchers have investigated the existence of various forms of grammar in the production and comprehension of songs by birds. Here, we argue that mating dances are another relevant source of sexually-selected complexity that has until now been largely overlooked by proponents of Darwinian protolanguage, focusing especially on the dances of long-tailed manakins. We end by sketching several lines of research that should be pursued to determine the relevance of mating dances to the evolution of language. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature 2017.

ABSTRACT: Honey bee dance has been intensively studied as a communication system, and yet we still know very little about the neurobiological mechanisms supporting how dances are produced and interpreted. Here, we discuss how new information on the functions of the central complex (CX) of the insect brain might shed some light on possible neural mechanisms of dance behaviour. We summarise the features of dance communication across the species of the genus Apis. We then propose that neural mechanisms of orientation and spatial processing found to be supported by the CX may function in dance communication also, and that this mechanistic link could explain some specific features of the dance form. This is purely a hypothesis, but in proposing this hypothesis, and how it might be investigated, we hope to stimulate new mechanistic analyses of dance communication. © 2017.

ABSTRACT: During the Second World War dancing boomed. This article, which discusses social dancing in Britain during the war, is oriented towards questions of morale; the "myth of the Blitz"; and the evolution of attitudes towards popular culture. It looks at how the unofficial efforts of dance hall owners dovetailed with official government efforts to raise morale; how such efforts shared in national myth making, creating a host of images and examples of philanthropy and bravery vital to patriotic propaganda. It also examines how the dance hall industry successfully navigated the challenges of wartime in order to alter perceptions about dancing and secure both its immediate and long-term future. Despite serving important functions, social dancing's role in the war effort has received little detailed attention. Where it has been studied, emphasis has been placed on episodes of racially motivated conflict at dances, primarily between American GIs. This article will thus provide the first detailed examination of dancing's wider wartime role. Moreover, it speaks to several key aspects of the historiography of the Second World War and of twentieth century British popular culture. It provides new evidence for the use of recreation and leisure as a strategy for boosting morale during the war. It helps us better understand the nature of propaganda and morale boosting measures taken during the war and highlights the often sluggish response of the government to utilizing all avenues of propaganda. Furthermore, it allows us to consider changing attitudes towards popular culture during wartime. © The Author 2016. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Recently theorists have developed competing accounts of the origins and nature of protolanguage and the subsequent evolution of language. Debate over these accounts is lively. Participants ask: Is music a direct precursor of language? Were the first languages gestural? Or is language continuous with primate vocalizations, such as the alarm calls of vervets? In this article I survey the leading hypotheses and lines of evidence, favouring a largely gestural conception of protolanguage. However, the “sticking point” of gestural accounts, to use Robbins Burling’s phrase, is the need to explain how language shifted to a largely vocal medium. So with a critical eye I consider Michael Corballis’s most recent expression of his ideas about this transition (2017’s The Truth About Language: What It Is And Where It Came From). Corballis’s view is an excellent foil to mine and I present it as such. Contrary to Corballis’s account, and developing Burling’s conjecture that musicality played some role, I argue that the foundations of an evolving musicality (i.e., evolving largely independently of language) provided the means and medium for the shift from gestural to vocal dominance in language. In other words, I suggest that an independently evolving musicality prepared ancient hominins, morphologically and cognitively, for intentional articulate vocal production, enabling the evolution of speech. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature

ABSTRACT: The main negative factors of urbanization are both, environmental problems (pollution of the urban environment, increase of building density, decrease of the green area, etc.), and the destructive influence of the big city on human health (emotional discomfort and stress among inhabitants, mental overloads leading people to alienation from the urban environment, etc.). In the article a new hybrid technological model of modular autonomous house "urbanrelax" will be proposed, designed to reduce the negative effects of urbanization on the human psyche, while not causing additional harm to the ecology of the urban environment on the basis of synergy of technologies, ecology, music and psychology. Power supply system of the model for mobile modular non-commercial building up to 20 m2 with elements of a smart system, using solar and wind power with no connections to external engineering will be suggested. Design of power technological system (including heating, ventilation, lighting, light and music background, etc.) will be taking into account. As an outcome, a model of complex system is planned based on synergy of various science sectors as energy, medicine, music and smart grid technologies. © 2017 European Union.

ABSTRACT: With the digitalization of music, the number of collection of music increased largely and there is a need to create lists of music that filter the collection according to user preferences, thus giving rise to the Automatic Playlist Generation Problem (APGP). Previous attempts to solve this problem include the use of search and optimization algorithms. If a music database is very large, the algorithm to be used must be able to search the lists thoroughly taking into account the quality of the playlist given a set of user constraints. In this paper we perform an evolutionary meta-heuristic optimization algorithm, Differential Evolution (DE) using different combination of parameter values and select the best performing set when used to solve four standard test functions. Performance of the proposed algorithm is then compared with normal Genetic Algorithm (GA) and a hybrid GA with Tabu Search. Numerical simulations are carried out to show better results from Differential Evolution approach with the optimized parameter values. © 2017 Author(s).

ABSTRACT: For all its hermeneutic density the voice is a profoundly malleable object. By drawing our attention away from the ‘grain’ of the voice to networks of vocality, this article explores how modern mediations of the voice––from the microphone to auto-tune––illustrate its co-evolution with a history of non-human circuits and exchanges. The voice is categorized as an assemblage in the sense suggested by Deleuzian theoretical currents and actor network theory: a multi-scalar, human–non-human hybrid that emerges through nested constellations. Four vocal modalities––synthesis, deconstruction, auto-correlation, and simulation––are identified as integral to a modern history of vocal breaching experiments that transform what voices can be and how they are heard. The final part of the paper explores how these extensions play out in relation to the Japanese virtual singer, performer, and idol, Hatsune Miku. Miku’s voice, it will be argued, is constituted at the intersection of crowd-sourcing, corporate investment and the algorithm. But it also illustrates the distributed ontology of all voices. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group

ABSTRACT: In his book on sexual selection, Darwin [1] devoted equal space to non-vocal and vocal communication in birds. Since then, vocal communication has become a model for studies of neurobiology, learning, communication, evolution, and conservation [2, 3]. In contrast, non-vocal “instrumental music,” as Darwin called it, has only recently become subject to sustained inquiry [4, 5]. In particular, outstanding work reveals how feathers, often highly modified, produce distinctive sounds [6–9], and suggests that these sounds have evolved at least 70 times, in many orders [10]. It remains to be shown, however, that such sounds are signals used in communication. Here we show that crested pigeons (Ochyphaps lophotes) signal alarm with specially modified wing feathers. We used video and feather-removal experiments to demonstrate that the highly modified 8th primary wing feather (P8) produces a distinct note during each downstroke. The sound changes with wingbeat frequency, so that birds fleeing danger produce wing sounds with a higher tempo. Critically, a playback experiment revealed that only if P8 is present does the sound of escape flight signal danger. Our results therefore indicate, nearly 150 years after Darwin's book, that modified feathers can be used for non-vocal communication, and they reveal an intrinsically reliable alarm signal. Many birds produce distinct sounds with feathers, but it is unclear whether they are signals. Murray et al. show experimentally that modified wing feathers of crested pigeons produce distinct sounds that act as alarm signals during escape flights. Listeners flee on hearing these alarms, which intrinsically link signal production with signal meaning. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: We present the large statistics of the galaxy effective radius R e in the rest-frame far-infrared (FIR) wavelength obtained from 1627 Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 1 mm band maps that become public by 2017 July. Our ALMA sample consists of 1034 sources with the star formation rate and the stellar mass at z = 0-6. We homogeneously derive and FIR luminosity L FIR of our ALMA sources via the uv-visibility method with the exponential disk model, carefully evaluating selection and measurement incompletenesses by realistic Monte-Carlo simulations. We find that there is a positive correlation between and L FIR at the &gt;99% significance level. The best-fit power-law function, , provides , and shows that at a fixed L FIR decreases toward high redshifts. The best-fit α and the redshift evolution of are similar to those of R e in the rest-frame UV (optical) wavelength Re(Opt.) revealed by Hubble Space Telescope (HST) studies. We identify that our ALMA sources have significant trends of Re(FIR)≈Re(UV)and Re(Opt.), which suggests that the dusty starbursts take place in compact regions. Moreover, of our ALMA sources is comparable to of quiescent galaxies at z ∼ 1-3 as a function of stellar mass, supporting the evolutionary connection between these two galaxy populations. We also investigate rest-frame UV and optical morphologies of our ALMA sources with deep HST images, and find that ∼30%-40% of our ALMA sources are classified as major mergers. This indicates that dusty starbursts are triggered by not only the major mergers but also the other mechanism(s). © 2017. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: This paper describes a work in progress on co-evolving Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for music improvisation. Using this neuro-evolutionary approach the ANNs adapt to the changes in the human player's music as input, while still maintaining some of the structure of the musical piece previously evolved. The system is called Primal-Improv and evolves modules that are composed of two ANNs, one controlling pitch and one controlling rhythm. The results of a quantitative study show that, by only introducing simple rules as fitness functions, the system is able to generate more interesting arrangements than ANNs evolved without a specific objective. The emerging and interesting musical patterns that are produced by the evolved ANNs hint at the promising potential of the system. © 2017 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Isochrony is crucial to the rhythm of human music. Some neural, behavioral and anatomical traits underlying rhythm perception and production are shared with a broad range of species. These may either have a common evolutionary origin, or have evolved into similar traits under different evolutionary pressures. Other traits underlying rhythm are rare across species, only found in humans and few other animals. Isochrony, or stable periodicity, is common to most human music, but isochronous behaviors are also found in many species. It appears paradoxical that humans are particularly good at producing and perceiving isochronous patterns, although this ability does not conceivably confer any evolutionary advantage to modern humans. This article will attempt to solve this conundrum. To this end, we define the concept of isochrony from the present functional perspective of physiology, cognitive neuroscience, signal processing, and interactive behavior, and review available evidence on isochrony in the signals of humans and other animals. We then attempt to resolve the paradox of isochrony by expanding an evolutionary hypothesis about the function that isochronous behavior may have had in early hominids. Finally, we propose avenues for empirical research to examine this hypothesis and to understand the evolutionary origin of isochrony in general. © 2017 Ravignani and Madison.

ABSTRACT: This article discusses the evolution of concert dance in Israel from the 1920s to the current blossoming of the 2010s. The way dance in Israel has evolved reflects the many changes in Israeli society, including ideological, social and political changes, as well as influences of dance genres from abroad, globalisation and post-modernism. The article argues that the engines that have driven dance in Israel along the timeline are change and choices. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Music learning studies have shown the extraordinary evolutionary power in early childhood. Indeed, the learning of music has been shown to have an influence on the psycho-physical development according to psycho-dynamic perspective, on the development of intelligence, and finally on the design of new technologies. The first studies on musical learning based on a psycho-dynamic perspective date back to Freudian essays. The relationship between intelligence and music in contemporary studies has reached a high degree of parameterization with the investigation of all involved dimensions and recently studies on musical learning are producing specific research in the field of acoustic and audio technology. The purpose of this study is to highlight the relationship between these three dimensions and musical learning as well as to suggest new integrate perspectives to follow in the field of research projects. © The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology.

ABSTRACT: Quality of life of disabled people in developed societies is one of the main issues to be achieved by evolution of technological solutions as well as obtaining low-cost equipment for achievement this purpose. Some equipment has been developed, and presented, and several studies have been performed about this subject. However, most of them present some gaps that are partially solved in this work. This paper describes a systematic approach and a final prototype for helping deaf people to feel music rhythm. The system hardware includes an audio sensor, two microcontrollers and light and vibrotactile outputs for transmitting the feeling of music rhythm. Also, a software interface has been developed. The prototype has been tested in several institutions that take care of deaf people. About 45 persons tested the equipment and the results achieved are encouraging. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Harmony search (HS) algorithm is inspired by the music improvisation process in which a musician searches for the best harmony and continues to polish the harmony to improve its aesthetics. The efficiency of evolutionary algorithms depends on the extent of balance between diversification and intensification during the course of the search. An ideal evolutionary algorithm must have efficient exploration in the beginning and enhanced exploitation toward the end. In this paper, a two-phase harmony search (TPHS) algorithm is proposed that attempts to strike a balance between exploration and exploitation by concentrating on diversification in the first phase using catastrophic mutation and then switches to intensification using local search in the second phase. The performance of TPHS is analyzed and compared with 4 state-of-the-art HS variants on all the 30 IEEE CEC 2014 benchmark functions. The numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed TPHS algorithm in terms of accuracy, particularly on multimodal functions when compared with other state-of-the-art HS variants; further comparison with state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms reveals excellent performance of TPHS on composition functions. Composition functions are combined, rotated, shifted, and biased version of other unimodal and multimodal test functions and mimic the difficulties of real search spaces by providing a massive number of local optima and different shapes for different regions of the search space. The performance of the TPHS algorithm is also evaluated on a real-life problem from the field of computer vision called camera calibration problem, ie, a 12-dimensional highly nonlinear optimization problem with several local optima. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: The Hammond organ is one of earliest electronic instruments and is still used widely in contemporary popular music. One of its main sonic features is the "key-click," a transient that occurs upon note onset, caused by the mechanical bouncing of the nine electric contacts actuated during each key press. A study of the dynamic mechanical behaviour of the contact bounces is presented, showing that the velocity, the type of touch and, more in general, the temporal evolution of the key position, all affect different characteristics of the contact bounces. A second study focuses on the listener's perception of the generated sound and finds that listeners can classify sounds produced on the Hammond organ according to the type of touch and velocity used. It is concluded that the Hammond organ is a touch-responsive instrument and that the gesture used to produce a note affects the generated sound across multiple dimensions. The control available at the fingertips of the musician is therefore such that it cannot be easily reduced to a single scalar velocity parameter, as is common practice in modern digital emulations of the instrument. © 2017 Author(s).

ABSTRACT: This study aims at portraying the gradual change in the status of the English as a Foreign Language (EFL) subject within the Ecuadorian National Curriculum for public primary schools since it was introduced in the curriculum in 2000. For the achievement of this purpose, we performed a review of public documents including Ministry of Education agreements, studies performed by UNESCO as well as data from official webpages, and newspapers. The results showed that the introduction of the EFL subject in the curriculum of public primary schools in 2000 resulted from the attempts made by the administrators of the CRADLE project since 1993. In 2000, English was introduced as an elective subject. It could only be taught in the establishments that had the facilities and specialized human resources. School principals had the say whether to incorporate EFL, Music, or Manual Arts in the periods assigned for the elective subject. In 2011, the status of the subject changed to as complementary activities. EFL and Computing were the choices this time. In March 2014, the complementary activities were excluded from the primary school curriculum, generating a huge controversy around Ecuador. Consequently, the Ministry of Education claimed that EFL would be included again in the primary schools’ curriculum after having the curriculum for this subject and prepared human resources ready. EFL was officially implemented as a compulsory subject in all Ecuadorian public primary schools in September 2016 in the Sierra and Amazon region; and in 2017, in the coastal provinces. Space is left to study whether this subject is being incorporated in all schools or not. © The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology.

ABSTRACT: Vocal theories of the origin of language rarely make a case for the precursor functions that underlay the evolution of speech. The vocal expression of emotion is unquestionably the best candidate for such a precursor, although most evolutionary models of both language and speech ignore emotion and prosody altogether. I present here a model for a joint prosodic precursor of language and music in which ritualized group-level vocalizations served as the ancestral state. This precursor combined not only affective and intonational aspects of prosody, but also holistic and combinatorial mechanisms of phrase generation. From this common stage, there was a bifurcation to form language and music as separate, though homologous, specializations. This separation of language and music was accompanied by their (re)unification in songs with words. © 2017 Brown.

ABSTRACT: In the area of product design, adding user's kansei (feelings) on the products is important for emphasizing its value. Interactive Evolutionary Computation (IEC) is well known method that searches optimal or better media contents suited for each user's kansei. Some previous studies applied IEC into problem of multiple users. Purpose of the present study is to compare Distributed Interactive Genetic Algorithm (DIGA) and Interactive Genetic Algorithm (IGA) in a view point of creating music melody. We conducted listening experiments for investigating efficiency of the DIGA and IGA for creation of music melody. Ten persons were divided into five pairs, the pair participated in the experiment as subjects simultaneously. As an index of searching space of the pair, distance of melodies between the subjects in the pair in each generation was investigated. As a result, a trend of decrease in the distance was observed in the DIGA where exchange of the best individuals between the subjects. © 2017 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: This article analyses the impact of digital distribution of music on business models developed by independent musicians. More specifically, it aims to analyse the main changes in the network of relationships between musicians and record companies, and between musicians and consumers; and to analyse how independent musicians’ business models have been evolving as a response to increasing change in the distribution of music. The data was collected through semi-structured interviews with independent musicians, music journalists, and small independent record labels. The article discusses empirically the main results regarding changes in the network of relationships under study and analyses the evolution of business models, concluding that independent musicians follow a diversification strategy, aiming to capture the business opportunities provided by technological changes in the distribution of music. The implications of such an option, including its main challenges, are discussed. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Research has been and will continue to be important to the music therapy profession, as evidenced by the number of studies examining the evolution of research in the field. Despite its seeming importance, no recent studies have investigated the extent to which music therapists find research relevant to practice and very few studies have examined this topic outside of the United States. The purposes of this study were to (a) examine the extent to which music therapists around the world view research as relevant to clinical practice and (b) among those who read research, identify which sections from scientific papers are read. This nonexperimental study involved an online survey of music therapists from 51 countries. Of the 1586 initially responding to the participant invitation, 1272 music therapists completed the survey (a completion rate of 80%). Findings suggest that music therapists find research to be relevant to clinical practice and perceptions differ as a function of educational attainment and occupational role. Results also evidenced similar educational and occupational differences with regard to reading scientific papers. These findings parallel those from earlier studies indicating those with higher educational attainment and working in academic/research-related positions tend to find research more relevant. These findings are important because they suggest there may be a disconnection between the extant research and the end consumer, the clinician. © 2017 GAMUT–The Grieg Academy Music Therapy Research Centre.

ABSTRACT: DJ Khaled is a popular musician that is known for having many collaborators in his songs. Hence, in this paper, we model the evolution of DJ Khaled's collaboration network as nine different networks that incrementally consider the albums of his discography. The network of each album includes the collaborations from previous ones and adds the collaborations from the new album. The artists are represented as nodes and the edges are the number of songs they appear together. Our focus is to answer whether or not: (i) we can identify meaningful communities in this network; and (2) there is an artist who has greater influence as networks emerges. By using the network average clustering coefficient, we found that the artists in the the network tend to naturally cluster in a logical manner. As a result, we identified nine communities, six of them are meaningful, and we identified the rapper Rick Ross as the most influential artist of the network. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

ABSTRACT: From the biological perspective human musicality is the term referred to as a set of abilities which enable the recognition and production of music. Since music is a complex phenomenon which consists of features that represent different stages of the evolution of human auditory abilities, the question concerning the evolutionary origin of music must focus mainly on music specific properties and their possible biological function or functions. What usually differentiates music from other forms of human sound expressions is a syntactically organized structure based on pitch classes and rhythmic units measured in reference to musical pulse. This structure is an auditory (not acoustical) phenomenon, meaning that it is a human-specific interpretation of sounds achieved thanks to certain characteristics of the nervous system. There is historical and cross-cultural diversity of this structure which indicates that learning is an important part of the development of human musicality. However, the fact that there is no culture without music, the syntax of which is implicitly learned and easily recognizable, suggests that human musicality may be an adaptive phenomenon. If the use of syntactically organized structure as a communicative phenomenon were adaptive it would be only in circumstances in which this structure is recognizable by more than one individual. Therefore, there is a problem to explain the adaptive value of an ability to recognize a syntactically organized structure that appeared accidentally as the result of mutation or recombination in an environment without a syntactically organized structure. The possible solution could be explained by the Baldwin effect in which a culturally invented trait is transformed into an instinctive trait by the means of natural selection. It is proposed that in the beginning musical structure was invented and learned thanks to neural plasticity. Because structurally organized music appeared adaptive (phenotypic adaptation) e.g., as a tool of social consolidation, our predecessors started to spend a lot of time and energy on music. In such circumstances, accidentally one individual was born with the genetically controlled development of new neural circuitry which allowed him or her to learn music faster and with less energy use. © 2017 Podlipniak.

ABSTRACT: Under the leadership of soprano Frances M Lynch, Minerva Scientifica deploys sung theatrical performances to encourage, celebrate and demonstrate the achievements of women in science and music. Based on collaborative discussions between practising female scientists and contemporary classical composers, the events staged by Minerva Scientifica are receiving high acclaim not only as educational and musical experiences for general audiences, but also for enhancing scientists’ appreciation of their own work. Adopting a historical approach, this article first explores the relationships between three pairs–women and science, music and science, women and music–before giving a more detailed account of the project’s evolution since 2011. © 2017 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining Published by Taylor & Francis on behalf of the Institute.

ABSTRACT: The African American revolutionary poetry outfit and purported grandfathers of rap The Last Poets coined their name from Keorapetse Kgositsile's poem “Towards a Walk in the Sun”. This is relatively common knowledge. However, no sustained academic research has been conducted on this crucial exchange in diasporic studies. In this paper, I show how Kgositsile's poem in question harvested the rich oral, aural, and literary practices of his native Setswana, which in turn enabled The Last Poets to not only draw a name from Kgositsile's poetry, but also a language and poetic. This way, I demonstrate multivalent streams of influences between black South Africa and black America, as opposed to the current one-way exchange in scholarship that almost always presents black South Africans as emulators and mimickers of Afro-American culture. I expose how Kgositsile's poetry trans/figures both Afro-American literary and musical histories. Functioning within the framework of pan-Africanism, I uncover black music's transatlantic arch in Kgositsile's poetry, which unifies Africa, the Caribbean, and black America. I offer a deep analysis of that arch, and demonstrate its dynamic and complex networks which span generations and centuries, and continues to be generative till today. I focus particularly on the evolution of orality and aurality in black expressive cultures, understood as practices that express the black cultural continuum on both sides of the Atlantic. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Why do people sing to babies? Human infants are relatively altricial and need their parents’ attention to survive. Infant-directed song may constitute a signal of that attention. In Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), a rare disorder of genomic imprinting, genes from chromosome 15q11–q13 that are typically paternally expressed are unexpressed, which results in exaggeration of traits that reduce offspring’s investment demands on the mother. PWS may thus be associated with a distinctive musical phenotype. We report unusual responses to music in people with PWS. Subjects with PWS (N = 39) moved more during music listening, exhibited greater reductions in heart rate in response to music listening, and displayed a specific deficit in pitch-discrimination ability relative to typically developing adults and children (N = 589). Paternally expressed genes from 15q11–q13, which are unexpressed in PWS, may thus increase demands for music and enhance perceptual sensitivity to music. These results implicate genomic imprinting in the psychology of music, informing theories of music’s evolutionary history. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.

ABSTRACT: Throughout her artistic career, Madonna has been notorious for her provocative gender displays. Academic literature has highlighted the ambivalence of many of her performances in this regard: although she occupies masculine spaces and roles, she often adopts positions that are in line with a traditional kind of femininity or with representation patterns that are part of and reinforce patriarchal discourse. Our analysis of Madonna’s music videos reveals the transformation that takes place in the artist’s gender displays. In this analysis we pay special attention to postfeminist features such as self-sexualization and the use of violence. Through three of the artist’s videos that employ the bullfighting metaphor, we see how the representation of femininity embodied by Madonna is transformed – within the framework of a sexual and affective relationship – from her position as a victim and passive female to that of aggressor. © 2017 Intellect Ltd Article.

ABSTRACT: The importance of masculine display in courtship and mate selection has been well established by research in the fields of evolutionary psychology and anthropology. Men advertise qualities women find desirable: ambition, intelligence, or strength, for example, including specialized talents fueling accomplishment in music, literature, or graphic design. The role played by artistic virtuosity in sexual selection provides incontrovertible evidence for the adaptive value of the arts, a topic currently inspiring cross-disciplinary research and theoretical debate. The poem "Serenade" by former Poet Laureate Billy Collins speaks to this issue, introducing an ardent male whose courtship tactics emphasize aesthetic excellence and novelty. © 2017 Johns Hopkins University Press.

ABSTRACT: Language as a computational cognitive mechanism appears to be unique to the human species. However, there are remarkable behavioral similarities between song learning in songbirds and speech acquisition in human infants that are absent in non-human primates. Here we review important neural parallels between birdsong and speech. In both cases there are separate but continually interacting neural networks that underlie vocal production, sensorimotor learning, and auditory perception and memory. As in the case of human speech, neural activity related to birdsong learning is lateralized, and mirror neurons linking perception and performance may contribute to sensorimotor learning. In songbirds that are learning their songs, there is continual interaction between secondary auditory regions and sensorimotor regions, similar to the interaction between Wernicke's and Broca's areas in human infants acquiring speech and language. Taken together, song learning in birds and speech acquisition in humans may provide useful insights into the evolution and mechanisms of auditory-vocal learning. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Most heritage musical instruments are not played anymore for conservation reasons. Most of the time, each instrument is the only representation left of a style or a historical period. This is coherent with the museums’ task, which is to present diversity in makers, making processes, materials, etc. It is thus interesting to study not only an instrument but also its evolution according to music history or to technical evolution. Studying the whole production of a maker allows a better understanding of his know-how and his technical evolution. Nevertheless, the museum audience has no way to evaluate the acoustical properties of these historical instruments except when a copy (or fac-simile) is ordered. This paper intends to apply a global vibrational analysis on the harp corpus of the Musée de la musique to understand the consequences on the potential acoustical behaviour of the different construction techniques used by two famous harp makers, Erard and Cousineau. The idea is to survey the whole corpus, using the least invasive techniques which are still effective when applied to instruments in a conservation state and to define a vibrational descriptor able to represent different making strategies from the acoustical point of view. Whereas usual descriptive measurements do not discriminate Erard and Cousineau harps’ acoustical behaviours, vibrational measurements, which are strongly influenced by construction techniques, do give this possibility. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS

ABSTRACT: Interaction with the world is a multisensory experience, but most of what is known about the neural correlates of perception comes from studying vision. Auditory inputs enter cortex with its own set of unique qualities, and leads to use in oral communication, speech, music, and the understanding of emotional and intentional states of others, all of which are central to the human experience. To better understand how the auditory system develops, recovers after injury, and how it may have transitioned in its functions over the course of hominin evolution, advances are needed in models of how the human brain is organized to process real-world natural sounds and “auditory objects”. This review presents a simple fundamental neurobiological model of hearing perception at a category level that incorporates principles of bottom-up signal processing together with top-down constraints of grounded cognition theories of knowledge representation. Though mostly derived from human neuroimaging literature, this theoretical framework highlights rudimentary principles of real-world sound processing that may apply to most if not all mammalian species with hearing and acoustic communication abilities. The model encompasses three basic categories of sound-source: (1) action sounds (non-vocalizations) produced by ‘living things’, with human (conspecific) and non-human animal sources representing two subcategories; (2) action sounds produced by ‘non-living things’, including environmental sources and human-made machinery; and (3) vocalizations (‘living things’), with human versus non-human animals as two subcategories therein. The model is presented in the context of cognitive architectures relating to multisensory, sensory-motor, and spoken language organizations. The models’ predictive values are further discussed in the context of anthropological theories of oral communication evolution and the neurodevelopment of spoken language proto-networks in infants/toddlers. These phylogenetic and ontogenetic frameworks both entail cortical network maturations that are proposed to at least in part be organized around a number of universal acoustic-semantic signal attributes of natural sounds, which are addressed herein. © 2017

ABSTRACT: The therapeutic effects of drugs are well known to result from their interaction with multiple intracellular targets. Accordingly, the pharma industry is currently moving from a reductionist approach based on a ‘one-target fixation’ to a holistic multitarget approach. However, many drug discovery practices are still procedural abstractions resulting from the attempt to understand and address the action of biologically active compounds while preventing adverse effects. Here, we discuss how drug discovery can benefit from the principles of evolutionary biology and report two real-life case studies. We do so by focusing on the desirability principle, and its many features and applications, such as machine learning-based multicriteria virtual screening. Here, we describe a multicriteria virtual screening approach based on desirability functions and tailored ensemble machine-learning classifiers. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Most networks, such as those generated from social media, tend to evolve gradually with frequent changes in the activity and the interactions of their participants. Furthermore, the communities inside the network can grow, shrink, merge, or split, and the entities can move from one community to another. The aim of community detection methods is precisely to detect the evolution of these communities. However, evaluating these algorithms requires tests on real or artificial networks with verifiable ground truth. Dynamic networks generators have been recently proposed for this task, but most of them consider only the structure of the network, disregarding the characteristics of the nodes. In this paper, we propose a new generator for dynamic attributed networks with community structure that follow the properties of real-world networks. The evolution of the network is performed using two kinds of operations: Micro-operations are applied on the edges and vertices, while macro-operations on the communities. Moreover, the properties of real-world networks such as preferential attachment or homophily are preserved during the evolution of the network, as confirmed by our experiments. © 2017, Springer-Verlag London.

ABSTRACT: Despite evolutionary musicology's interdisciplinary nature, and the diverse methods it employs, the field has nevertheless tended to divide into two main positions. Some argue that music should be understood as a naturally selected adaptation, while others claim that music is a product of culture with little or no relevance for the survival of the species. We review these arguments, suggesting that while interesting and well-reasoned positions have been offered on both sides of the debate, the nature-or-culture (or adaptation vs. non-adaptation) assumptions that have traditionally driven the discussion have resulted in a problematic either/or dichotomy. We then consider an alternative "biocultural" proposal that appears to offer a way forward. As we discuss, this approach draws on a range of research in theoretical biology, archeology, neuroscience, embodied and ecological cognition, and dynamical systems theory (DST), positing a more integrated model that sees biological and cultural dimensions as aspects of the same evolving system. Following this, we outline the enactive approach to cognition, discussing the ways it aligns with the biocultural perspective. Put simply, the enactive approach posits a deep continuity between mind and life, where cognitive processes are explored in terms of how self-organizing living systems enact relationships with the environment that are relevant to their survival and well-being. It highlights the embodied and ecologically situated nature of living agents, as well as the active role they play in their own developmental processes. Importantly, the enactive approach sees cognitive and evolutionary processes as driven by a range of interacting factors, including the socio-cultural forms of activity that characterize the lives of more complex creatures such as ourselves. We offer some suggestions for how this approach might enhance and extend the biocultural model. To conclude we briefly consider the implications of this approach for practical areas such as music education. © 2017 van der Schyff and Schiavio.

ABSTRACT: Music is a paradigmatic domain of creative activity, culturally ubiquitous and manifested in a multitude of ways. Here I explore music as a domain of human creativity - both as a specific "content" domain informing productive aspects of musical creativity, and as a domain of mind, whose evolutionary backstory constrains the reception of music. In discussing the phylogenetic emergence of human musicality, I highlight possible tensions in the creative dynamic between novelty and canalized aesthetic preferences. A richer discussion of the creative process in music follows, illustrated by anecdotal and interview accounts as well as laboratory and archival studies, which collectively have shed substantial light on contemporary theories of creativity. I close by discussing the role of socio-cultural factors in musical creativity and some possible future directions for research. © Cambridge University Press 2017. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Recent theoretical advances in the evolution of music posit that affective communication is an evolutionary function of music through which the mind and brain are transformed. A rigorous test of this view should entail examining the neuroanatomical mechanisms for affective communication of music, specifically by comparing individual differences in the general population with a special population who lacks specific affective responses to music. Here we compare white matter connectivity in BW, a case with severe musical anhedonia, with a large sample of control subjects who exhibit normal variability in reward sensitivity to music. We show for the first time that structural connectivity within the reward system can predict individual differences in musical reward in a large population, but specific patterns in connectivity between auditory and reward systems are special in an extreme case of specific musical anhedonia. Results support and extend the Mixed Origins of Music theory by identifying multiple neural pathways through which music might operate as an affective signaling system. © 2017 Loui, Patterson, Sachs, Leung, Zeng and Przysinda.

ABSTRACT: Whether music and language evolved independently of each other or whether both evolved from a common precursor remains a hotly debated topic. We here emphasize the role of vowels in the language-music relationship, arguing for a shared heritage of music and speech. Vowels play a decisive role in generating the sound or sonority of syllables, the main vehicles for transporting prosodic information in speech and singing. Timbre is, beyond question, the primary parameter that allows us to discriminate between different vowels, but vowels also have intrinsic pitch, intensity, and duration. There are striking correspondences between the number of vowels and the number of pitches in musical scales across cultures: an upper limit of roughly 12 elements, a lower limit of 2, and a frequency peak at 5-7 elements. Moreover, there is evidence for correspondences between vowels and scales even in specific cultures, e.g., cultures with three vowels tend to have tritonic scales. We report a match between vowel pitch and musical pitch in meaningless syllables of Alpine yodelers, and highlight the relevance of vocal timbre in the music of many non-Western cultures, in which vocal timbre/vowel timbre and musical melody are often intertwined. Studies showing the pivotal role of vowels and their musical qualities in the ontogeny of language and in infant directed speech, will be used as further arguments supporting the hypothesis that music and speech evolved from a common prosodic precursor, where the vowels exhibited both pitch and timbre variations. © 2017 Fenk-Oczlon.

ABSTRACT: While music improvisation is an NP-hard problem, it has always been handled by musicians successfully. Harmony search is a class of meta-heuristics inspired by the improvisation process of musicians. Inexperienced musicians usually make several harmonies until they find the desired one. However, experienced musicians more rely on their knowledge and experience instead of brute-force searching for a desired harmony. When making a harmony, they are able to distinguish the undesired notes of the current harmony and just modify them instead of throwing away the total harmony and making a new one. This approach of experienced musicians was adopted in this paper to allow the harmony search algorithm to exploit the knowledge and experience accumulated in the harmony memory to refine current harmonies. The underlying algorithm is called Selective Refining Harmony Search in which a new harmony memory update has been utilized. The main differences between the proposed method and the original harmony search are the integration of selection in the improvisation step and introduction of refinement concept. The improvements provided by the proposed method originate from its superior ability to imitate the behavior of musicians in the sense that instead of total harmonies, decision variables are considered during the memory update process. This modification provided outstanding performance to minimize the objective functions of the underlying problems, while computational loads are also better than other methods in most cases. During refinement procedure, two new parameters were employed to make a trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency of the algorithm. During the experiments, the proposed method exhibited robust performance against its two new parameters. Several algorithms including original harmony search and its state-of-the-art variants were implemented to conduct comprehensive comparisons. All of the algorithms were evaluated over IEEE CEC 2010 suite, one of the well-known and challenging benchmark test sets. Several studies have evidenced that the utilization of harmony search has been fostered in diverse application fields. Thus, the improvements to harmony search algorithm provided by the proposed method makes it more efficient for those fields and possible to be employed for more challenging problems. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Human interaction through music is a vital part of social life across cultures. Influential accounts of the evolutionary origins of music favor cooperative functions related to social cohesion or competitive functions linked to sexual selection. However, work on non-human "chorusing" displays, as produced by congregations of male insects and frogs to attract female mates, suggests that cooperative and competitive functions may coexist. In such chorusing, rhythmic coordination between signalers, which maximizes the salience of the collective broadcast, can arise through competitive mechanisms by which individual males jam rival signals. Here, we show that mixtures of cooperative and competitive behavior also occur in human music. Acoustic analyses of the renowned St. Thomas Choir revealed that, in the presence of female listeners, boys with the deepest voices enhance vocal brilliance and carrying power by boosting high spectral energy. This vocal enhancement may reflect sexually mature males competing for female attention in a covert manner that does not undermine collaborative musical goals. The evolutionary benefits of music may thus lie in its aptness as a medium for balancing sexually motivated behavior and group cohesion. © 2017 Keller, König and Novembre.

ABSTRACT: As the motto of the Conference ARTECH 2017, the interface is really now the way in which communication takes place. This is seen both in the way in which technology affects the artistic creation in all fields of the arts for new creation, and also when we try to recreate a message contained in works from the recent past. In this poster, I try to show the results of a new interpretation with an interactive interface of a music piece composed using experimental analogic technologies. The piece is SOLO for a melodic instrument and feedback, composed in 1966 by Karlheinz Stockhausen, a pioneer of electronic music. At that time the realisation of this work needed the collaboration of three or four sound engineers. The piece was then proposed in the following years by the author itself in a digital version, when that becomes possible through technological evolution. In the last years the evolution of technology allows us to re create and perform the piece using an interactive interface. The performer can play itself the whole composition (instrumental and electronic part) and reach even an improvisation. The latter step of this evolution is made possible by a new application, consisting in an interactive interface to reproduce the same patterns of the composer's conception but in an interactive way. The application has been tested by single performers and also by a group of performers creating an improvisation. © 2017 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

ABSTRACT: The tired old civilisational categories of ‘East’ and ‘West’, loosely identified with ‘Islam’ and ‘modernity’, are alive and well, nowhere more so than in contemporary Turkey. The Justice Development Party (AKP) currently in government employs them assiduously to political advantage but they have a long history, having defined the parameters of societal identity and political discourse throughout the history of the Turkish Republic. The paper takes the strength of the categories as its starting point but moves beyond them by asking if discourses, narratives and identities, individual and collective, exist in Turkey which question, overcome and ultimately undermine the categories of ‘East’ and ‘West’. The paper starts by investigating the evolution of ideas about East and West since the late Ottoman period and accepts that they are still dominant. However, since the 1980s in particular, they are being undermined in a de facto way by cultural developments in literature and music, new trends in historiography and novel ways of relating to the past. In some ways in contemporary Turkey, the paper concludes, culture trumps the inherently essentialist idea of ‘civilisation’ and Turkish society is ahead of its political and intellectual elites. © 2017 Southseries Inc., www.thirdworldquarterly.com.

ABSTRACT: Emotion elicited through music transfers to subsequent processing of facial expressions. Music may accordingly function as a social technology by promoting social bonding. Here, we investigated whether music would cross-modally influence the perception of sensual touch, a behavior related to mating. A robot applied precisely controlled gentle touch to a group of healthy participants while they listened to music that varied with respect to its perceived sexiness. As the perceived sexiness of the music increased, so did the subjective sexiness of the touch stimulations. In short, the perception of sexiness transferred from music to touch. Because sensual touch is key to mating behavior and relates to procreation, this association has implications for the universality and evolutionary significance of music. © 2017 American Psychological Association.

ABSTRACT: Since not long ago independent urban music production was stirred up by digital change and dramatic shifts in music markets. Local scenes of producers, labels, clubs and DJs have been challenged to cope with new digital formats while keeping up balance with the requirements of musical style, local and global audiences, and urban embeddings of music production. It is the specific combination of pressure coming from disruptive music markets, emerging socio-technical and socio-cultural socialities, and technological options, which determines musicians moving. ‘Trial and error’ practices have become an appealing undertaking for some, as well as a last resort for others. For agents in scene-based music production this ambiguous challenge assumes a particular shape. The paper develops the concept of sonic capital to get analytical clue to scene-based value creation. It addresses a specific knowledge-based capacity acquired by professional agents and users/consumers to keep up with the co-evolution of musical styles, technology, markets and urban social environments. On the empirical basis of interviews with independent label owners, producers and DJs in the Techno and House scene of the city of Berlin, typical strategies are identified which relate to the task of gaining context-related knowledge, developing trial-and-error routines, and performing contingent turns in business concepts and creative procedures. By applying a modification of Bourdieuian notions of capital formation to shifts in the urban music business, the tangle of recent social, economic and spatial reallocations of value creation becomes more comprehensible. © 2017

ABSTRACT: Music is a significant achievement of human activities and culture. Composing music is a complex and challenging task in that many factors, such as scale, key, chord, rhythm, and pitch, and their interactions need to be considered. With the advance of computer technology and artificial intelligence, automatic composition systems emerge and present some promising results. In particular, composing music through evolutionary algorithms has received increasing attention. Although evolutionary approaches are capable of generating compositions that follow music theory, these compositions are easily recognized as machine-made products due to their unpredictability in melodic progression, which is an important factor affecting a human's impression and feeling on a song. This paper aims for an automatic composition system that emulates human intelligence in music composition. Specifically, we propose the phrase imitation-based evolutionary composition (PIEC) to generate compositions by an evolutionary algorithm based on music theory and imitation of the characteristics and melodic progression of human-composed music. The PIEC conducts intraphrase and interphrase rearrangement to imitate the ascending/descending motion of phrases. Furthermore, we design four fitness functions for the PIEC to evolve compositions considering note distribution, interval variance, and music theory. The experimental results show that the proposed PIEC can effectively generate satisfactory compositions with the characteristics of the sample melody. The results also validate the effects of phrase imitation and the four fitness functions on evolutionary composition. © 2007-2012 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: We present a theory of the origin and evolution of infant-directed song, a form of music found in many cultures. After examining the ancestral ecology of parent-infant relations, we propose that infant-directed song arose in an evolutionary arms race between parents and infants, stemming from the dynamics of parent-offspring conflict. We describe testable predictions that follow from this theory, consider some existing evidence for them, and entertain the possibility that infant-directed song could form the basis for the development of other, more complex forms of music. © 2017 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Over the course of Prince’s legendary career, there were some clear points of transition—points where his faith and musical genius intersected. Prince’s music often reflected his spiritual journey, and despite his conversion to the Jehovah’s Witnesses in the late 90s and early 2000s, he could never entirely shake the sexuality and sensuality he was known and loved for in the mainstream. In a way that worked, Prince found ways to merge his spiritual seeking with his sexual expressions in the music. This essay argues that while some in society, particularly legalists across many faiths, may attempt to categorize Prince’s wrestlings as a contradiction, in truth, this duality of his represents the way many artists—Black artists, in particular—reconcile the nuances of their creative work with any faith traditions or spiritual beliefs they may have. In the end, these beautiful complexities were a critical part of Prince’s spiritual and artistic evolution. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

ABSTRACT: IN A RECENT NATURE PAPER, MCDERMOTT ET AL.(2016) conclude that the perception of consonance arises from familiarity with the conventions of Western harmonic music and is relatively unconstrained by auditory neurobiology. We refute this idea, citing cross-cultural, developmental and comparative evidence to the contrary, and raising concerns over McDermott et al.'s methodology. We conclude that although familiarity plays an important role in shaping tonal preferences, it must not be cast in opposition to clear biological constraints. Biology and culture (nature and nurture) interact to shape how we experience music, and theories that neglect the former do so at their peril. © 2017 by the Regents of the University of California all rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Western contemporary dance has long benefited from mental imagery practice for enhancing choreography, somatic embodiment and performance. Although science supports many psychophysical benefits of mental imagery practice, less is known about its effects on dance creation. Here, two dance educators report the results of a pilot study using two contrasting imagery modes in teaching improvisation. Four conservatory dance students engaged in two weeks of improvisation. In week one, Glenna used tactile-kinaesthetic imagery as verbal prompts. During week two, Susan emphasized visual prompts. Each mode gave rise to unique movement patterns and reflections on embodiment, bearing on future research questions. The authors aim to situate the study within the conversation on imagery specificity in teaching improvisation. In addition, the study supports the ongoing evolution of an articulate scientific-somatic discourse on tactile-kinaesthetic and visual phenomena within dance. © 2017 Intellect Ltd Article.

ABSTRACT: In the area of product design, it is important that adding user's feelings on the products for emphasizing its value. Interactive Evolutionary Computation (IEC) is known as a method that searches optimal or better media contents suited for each user's feelings. In terms of expanding the ability of IEC, some recent studies applied IEC into problem of multiple users. This study aims to create music melody suited for multiple users' feelings by employing parallel Distributed Interactive Genetic Algorithm (DIGA). In this method, each of the users proceeds general Interactive Genetic Algorithm (IGA) process by evaluating solution candidates subjectively. In some generations, solution candidates are exchanged between the users. With the exchange, each of the users is affected by other users' feelings. As a result of these processes, obtaining good solution suited for all users. We conducted listening experiments for investigating efficiency of the DIGA for creation of music melody. Ten persons participated in the experiment as subjects, and pair of the subjects participated in the IGA task simultaneously. Experimental results show that higher fitness was obtained in the final generation, and similar melody was obtained through exchange of solutions. To clarify the efficiency of the exchange of the asynchronous method, further study with comparing experiment including conditions synchronous is needed. © 2017 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: It has been hypothesized that humans have evolved a hypersensitivity to detect intentional agents at a perceptual level, as failing to detect these agents may potentially be more harmful than incorrectly assuming that agents are absent. Following this logic, ambiguous threatening situations should lead people to falsely detect the presence of agents. In six threat-inducing experiments (N = 233) we have investigated whether threat induction increases agent detection. We operationalized human agent detection by means of a Biological Motion Detection Task (Experiments 1 and 2) and an Auditory Agent Detection Task (Experiment 4). Intentionality detection was operationalized by means of a Geometrical Figures Task (Experiment 3). Threat manipulations that were either weak (threatening pictures, classical horror music) or moderate (virtual reality) did not increase false human agent or intentionality detection. Moreover, participants generally had a response bias towards assuming that agents were absent (Experiments 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, and 4). Further, agent and intentionality detection measures were unrelated to individual differences in supernatural beliefs, although they were related to the negativity bias. This study reveals the boundary conditions under which the agent and intentionality detection is not intensified and provides recommendations for future research. © 2017 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Located in the Northern State of Punjab, the historic city of Patiala has always been a centre of culture in north India, and has seen the evolution of its own distinct style of architecture with Rajput and Mughal influences. The city is renowned for its rich architectural heritage, Music, Craft, Sports and Cuisine. The fourth Maharaja Narinder Singh was a great patron of art, architecture and music and it was during his time that several palaces like the Moti Bagh Palace, Sheesh Mahal and Banasur Bagh were designed followed by Baradari Palace. Later it was Maharaja Bhupinder Singh (1900-1938) who made Patiala State famous with his lavish lifestyle.This paper describes the process followed for Documentation and condition assessment of the historic Sheesh Mahal & Char Bagh Complex in order to restore and revitalise the palace building and the Mughal garden. The exercise included Archival research, Field surveys, Condition Mapping, inventories using traditional methods as well as GIS and preparation of restoration & conservation solutions along with post conservation management manual. The Major challenges encountered were identifying the correct documentation methodology for mapping as well as managing the large database generated on site. The Documentation and Mapping was used as a significant tool to guide towards the conservation and Management strategy of the complex. © Authors 2017. CC BY 4.0 License.

ABSTRACT: Human musical ability is proposed to play a key phylogenetical role in the evolution of language, and the similarity of hierarchical structure in music and language has led to considerable speculation about their shared mechanisms. While behavioral and electrophysioglocial studies have revealed associations between music and linguistic abilities, results from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies on their relations are contradictory, possibly because these studies usually treat music or language as single entities without breaking down to their components. Here, we examined the relations between different components of music (i.e., melodic and rhythmic analysis) and language (i.e., semantic and phonological processing) using both behavioral tests and resting-state fMRI. Behaviorally, we found that individuals with music training experiences were better at semantic processing, but not at phonological processing, than those without training. Further correlation analyses showed that semantic processing of language was related to melodic, but not rhythmic, analysis of music. Neurally, we found that performances in both semantic processing and melodic analysis were correlated with spontaneous brain activities in the bilateral precentral gyrus (PCG) and superior temporal plane at the regional level, and with the resting-state functional connectivity of the left PCG with the left supramarginal gyrus and left superior temporal gyrus at the network level. Together, our study revealed the shared spontaneous neural basis of music and language based on the behavioral link between melodic analysis and semantic processing, which possibly relied on a common mechanism of automatic auditory-motor integration. © 2017 IBRO

ABSTRACT: We study lithium depletion in low-mass and solar-like stars as a function of time, using a new diffusion coefficient describing extra-mixing taking place at the bottom of a convective envelope. This new form is motivated by multi-dimensional fully compressible, time-implicit hydrodynamic simulations performed with the MUSIC code. Intermittent convective mixing at the convective boundary in a star can be modeled using extreme value theory, a statistical analysis frequently used for finance, meteorology, and environmental science. In this Letter, we implement this statistical diffusion coefficient in a one-dimensional stellar evolution code, using parameters calibrated from multi-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of a young low-mass star. We propose a new scenario that can explain observations of the surface abundance of lithium in the Sun and in clusters covering a wide range of ages, from ∼50 Myr to ∼4 Gyr. Because it relies on our physical model of convective penetration, this scenario has a limited number of assumptions. It can explain the observed trend between rotation and depletion, based on a single additional assumption, namely, that rotation affects the mixing efficiency at the convective boundary. We suggest the existence of a threshold in stellar rotation rate above which rotation strongly prevents the vertical penetration of plumes and below which rotation has small effects. In addition to providing a possible explanation for the long-standing problem of lithium depletion in pre-main-sequence and main-sequence stars, the strength of our scenario is that its basic assumptions can be tested by future hydrodynamic simulations. © 2017.

ABSTRACT: While digitization of music, particularly streaming services, has gained increasing popularity, it has also led to a steady decline in the revenues of recorded music industry. This is causing strong concern regarding a potential collapse of the music industry comparable to other print media industries such as newspaper and book publishing. However, recent changes in the music industry initiated by a resurgence of the live music industry are giving rise to some expectations for the survival and growth of the music industry. The parallel paths of increasing popularity of streaming services and a resurgence of live music suggest that these two dynamics are working together in a co-evolutionary way toward the sustainability of the music industry. This paper attempts to elucidate the co-evolutionary dynamism between the increasing popularity of streaming music and the resurgence of live music. An empirical analysis of monthly trends over the period of the last three decades in the US music industry by its sectors revealed that (i) the co-evolution between streaming and live music industries has functioned well over the last few years, (ii) the live music industry has incorporated a self-propagating function by assimilating innovations previously initiated by digital music, (iii) given the above co-evolution, the recent resurging trend in the music industry can be sustained, (iv) the advancement of digital innovations such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, fintech, virtual reality, big data, and social media by enabling such coevolution have transformed the live music industry into a “live-concert-streaming music industry” (LCSMI) that further enabling the participative creativity of its stakeholders. For these collaborative and cultural industries to function in harmony, trust between its participating stakeholders is very crucial. This analysis suggests the significance of a trust-based ICT-driven disruptive business model (IDBM) with a consolidated challenge for social demand (CCSD) for the development of cultural industries. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: This paper discusses human musicality from a cognitive-evolutionist perspective. It reflects on the complexity of music manifestation in a panorama that articulates the periods between the remote times of the Homo sapiens species to their interaction in the era of Digital Culture. The reflections are based on research that shows uninterrupted music making that starts at the beginnings of humanity and continues significantly until the present moment, undergoing, however, transformations that are being accelerated by new digital technologies. This scenario also implies changes in the construction of musical performance, as well as in the concepts of learning and self-learning of music.

ABSTRACT: Many have argued that the expressive power of human thought comes from language. Language plays this role, so the argument goes, because its generative computations construct hierarchically structured, abstract representations, covering virtually any content and communicated in linguistic expressions. However, language is not the only domain to implement generative computations and abstract representations, and linguistic communication is not the only medium of expression. Mathematics, morality, and music are three others. These similarities are not, we argue, accidental. Rather, we suggest they derive from a common computational system that we call the Universal Generative Faculty or UGF. UGF is, at its core, a suite of contentless generative procedures that interface with different domains of knowledge to create contentful expressions in thought and action. The representational signatures of different domains are organized and synthesized by UGF into a global system of thought. What was once considered the language of thought is, on our view, the more specific operation of UGF and its interfaces to different conceptual domains. This view of the mind changes the conversation about domain-specificity, evolution, and development. On domain-specificity, we suggest that if UGF provides the generative engine for different domains of human knowledge, then the specificity of a given domain (e.g., language, mathematics, music, morality) is restricted to its repository of primitive representations and to its interfaces with UGF. Evolutionarily, some generative computations are shared with other animals (e.g., combinatorics), both for recognition-learning and generation-production, whereas others are uniquely human (e.g., recursion); in some cases, the cross-species parallels may be restricted to recognition-learning, with no observable evidence of generation-production. Further, many of the differences observed between humans and other animals, as well as among nonhuman animals, are the result of differences in the interfaces: whereas humans promiscuously traverse (consciously and unconsciously) interface conditions so as to combine and analogize concepts across many domains, nonhuman animals are far more limited, often restricted to a specific domain as well as a specific sensory modality within the domain. Developmentally, the UGF perspective may help explain why the generative powers of different domains appear at different stages of development. In particular, because UGF must interface with domain-specific representations, which develop on different time scales, the generative power of some domains may mature more slowly (e.g., mathematics) than others (e.g., language). This explanation may also contribute to a deeper understanding of cross-cultural differences among human populations, especially cases where the generative power of a domain appears absent (e.g., cultures with only a few count words). This essay provides an introduction to these ideas, including a discussion of implications and applications for evolutionary biology, human cognitive development, cross-cultural variation, and artificial intelligence. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: In this work, we debut a new implementation of IP-Glasma and quantify the pre-equilibrium longitudinal flow in the IP-Glasma framework. The saturation physics based IP-Glasma model naturally provides a non-zero initial longitudinal flow through its pre-equilibrium Yang-Mills evolution. A hybrid IP-Glasma+MUSIC+UrQMD frame-work is employed to test this new implementation against experimental data and to make further predictions about hadronic flow observables in Pb+Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV. Finally, the non-zero pre-equilibrium longitudinal flow of the IP-Glasma model is quantified, and its origin is briefly discussed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Analyses of stratigraphic sequences within the paleocanyons of the Hualapai Plateau, Arizona, are important because these deposits offer the only evidence for the Paleogene-Neogene geological history of the Grand Canyon area. In this paper, we focus on the origins and paleoenvironmental significance of the West Water Formation, located within the Milkweed and West Water paleocanyons on the Hualapai Plateau. We propose that the supposed “limestone unit” of the West Water Formation at and near its type section is not a limestone; rather, it is a 21 m-thick valley calcrete, overprinted by a ~ 1–2 m-thick pedogenic calcrete, and subsequently dolomitized in its upper-to-middle sections, with a superimposed 4 m-thick red paleosol. We also propose that this unit is not coeval in age or origin with the Long Point limestone on the Coconino Plateau, and that the presence of a complex calcrete-dolocrete-paleosol alters previous interpretations associated with this unit. Evidence for a calcrete-paleosol origin, beyond the West Water Formation's lack of fossils, includes: its predominantly micritic calcite-palygorskite composition; its textures characteristic of valley and pedogenic calcrete deposits (as exhibited by thin section, SEM, and TEM analyses); and its association with a relatively thick overlying red paleosol that also contains abundant palygorskite. Stable carbon and oxygen isotope values from carbonate cements are also within the range expected of a near-surface calcrete. Carbonate minerals within the calcrete-dolocrete were precipitated at or near the water table in a valley setting due to evaporation and/or CO2 degassing in a semi-arid to arid environment of deposition. High 87Sr/86Sr values within the calcrete were inherited from groundwater infiltrating through Music Mountain Formation arkosic sediments, which were derived from a Precambrian source terrane to the south and southwest. No absolute ages exist for the Music Mountain Formation and West Water Formation in the Milkweed and West Water paleocanyons; these sediments could range in age from the Late Cretaceous to the latest Eocene-earliest Oligocene, and may record the Eocene-Oligocene Transition in the Grand Canyon area. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: It has been proposed that languages evolve by adapting to the perceptual and cognitive constraints of the human brain, developing, in the course of cultural transmission, structural regularities that maximize or optimize learnability and ease of processing. To what extent would perceptual and cognitive constraints similarly affect the evolution of musical systems? We conducted an experiment on the cultural evolution of artificial melodic systems, using multi-generational signaling games as a laboratory model of cultural transmission. Signaling systems, using five-tone sequences as signals, and basic and compound emotions as meanings, were transmitted from senders to receivers along diffusion chains in which the receiver in each game became the sender in the next game. During transmission, structural regularities accumulated in the signaling systems, following principles of proximity, symmetry, and good continuation. Although the compositionality of signaling systems did not increase significantly across generations, we did observe a significant increase in similarity among signals from the same set. We suggest that our experiment tapped into the cognitive and perceptual constraints operative in the cultural evolution of musical systems, which may differ from the mechanisms at play in language evolution and change. © 2017 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

ABSTRACT: Turing's theory for biological pattern formation is based on the instability of the homogeneous state, which occurs if certain key criteria are met. The problem of how chemical energy is converted to localised biological work requires one to understand not only the basis of localised power generation, but also the age-old puzzle of how organisms decrease their entropy; these problems can only be solved by the identification of the Turing Instability. At the heart of this is how natural selection, not chemistry, has fashioned the large non-equilibrium overall affinity (ΔG is a large negative quantity) for the oxidation of the fuel molecules. Natural selection has also resulted in the homeostasis at non-equilibrium values of the hydrolysis of molecules like ATP, GTP, which are the energy links between the overall oxidation of the fuel and biological work. The conditions for such homeostasis are central requirements for the Turing Instability and are the essence of being alive. The Turing-Child (TC) patterns are the spontaneous primary spatial cause not only of localised biological work in multicellular systems (especially those in patterning and development) but also of intracellular patterns including the mitotic spindle and the contractile ring. The Turing picture comprises the nonuniform distribution of the concentrations of the Turing morphogens, cAMP and ATP, and the Child picture is the resulting nonuniform distribution of the metabolic rate and of power. The TC pattern is shaped as the dominant eigenfunction in the combination of eigenfunctions which provides the spatial pattern of the Turing morphogens. The TC patterns and the bifurcation parameter manifest quantisation and symmetry as in music and in applications of quantum mechanics. The notion of correlation diagrams is also introduced. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Context. In the interior of stars, a convectively unstable zone typically borders a zone that is stable to convection. Convective motions can penetrate the boundary between these zones, creating a layer characterized by intermittent convective mixing, and gradual erosion of the density and temperature stratification. Aims. We examine a penetration layer formed between a central radiative zone and a large convection zone in the deep interior of a young low-mass star. Using the Multidimensional Stellar Implicit Code (MUSIC) to simulate two-dimensional compressible stellar convection in a spherical geometry over long times, we produce statistics that characterize the extent and impact of convective penetration in this layer. Methods. We apply extreme value theory to the maximal extent of convective penetration at any time. We compare statistical results from simulations which treat non-local convection, throughout a large portion of the stellar radius, with simulations designed to treat local convection in a small region surrounding the penetration layer. For each of these situations, we compare simulations of different resolution, which have different velocity magnitudes. We also compare statistical results between simulations that radiate energy at a constant rate to those that allow energy to radiate from the stellar surface according to the local surface temperature. Results. Based on the frequency and depth of penetrating convective structures, we observe two distinct layers that form between the convection zone and the stable radiative zone. We show that the probability density function of the maximal depth of convective penetration at any time corresponds closely in space with the radial position where internal waves are excited. We find that the maximal penetration depth can be modeled by a Weibull distribution with a small shape parameter. Using these results, and building on established scalings for diffusion enhanced by large-scale convective motions, we propose a new form for the diffusion coefficient that may be used for one-dimensional stellar evolution calculations in the large Péclet number regime. These results should contribute to the 321D link. © 2017 ESO.

ABSTRACT: The genetic algorithm (GA) uses techniques inspired by evolutionary biology such as inheritance, mutation, selection, and crossover. Due to its ability to find approximate solutions of hard optimization, the GA is suited for applications in various domains. The GA-based composition system, which uses genetic algorithm to evolve music materials, has become a hot spot in the algorithmic composition. This paper discusses Chinese folk composition based on GA. A structure of GA-based Chinese folk composition system is presented. Evolutionary melody operators for Chinese folk music are proposed and the fitness functions are discussed in detail. Experimental results show that the model based on GA is feasible and effective in the process of Chinese folk music composition. © 2017 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Creative industries constantly strive for fame and popularity. Though highly desirable, popularity is not the only achievement artistic creations might ever acquire. Leaving a longstanding mark in the global production and influencing future works is an even more important achievement, usually acknowledged by experts and scholars. ‘Significant’ or ‘influential’ works are not always well known to the public or have sometimes been long forgotten by the vast majority. In this paper, we focus on the duality between what is successful and what is significant in the musical context. To this end, we consider a user-generated set of tags collected through an online music platform, whose evolving co-occurrence network mirrors the growing conceptual space underlying music production. We define a set of general metrics aiming at characterizing music albums throughout history, and their relationships with the overall musical production. We show how these metrics allow to classify albums according to their current popularity or their belonging to expert-made lists of important albums. In this way, we provide the scientific community and the public at large with quantitative tools to tell apart popular albums from culturally or aesthetically relevant artworks. The generality of the methodology presented here lends itself to be used in all those fields where innovation and creativity are in play. © 2017 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Evolutionary composition has received considerable attention in these years. An automatic composition system based on evolutionary computation is attractive but very challenging because the evaluation function is difficult to design: First, human's evaluation on a composition is subject to personal feeling and preference. Second, different regions form their unique music genres from local customs, lifestyle, or ethnic history. These genres enrich music diversity and human sensation. This study presents an evolutionary composition system to address the above two issues. More specifically, the proposed system adopts general music theory rules as the fundamentals of fitness evaluation, thereby ensuring the basic harmony and consonance. In addition, we explore the specific musical expressions of Flamenco and Argentine Tango, and include their features in the evolutionary composition system to create a fusion. Experimental results show that the generated music is satisfactory and can express the emphases of both Flamenco and Argentine Tango. © 2017 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: In recent times, several activities that lately were considered possible to do only by human work, have been replaced by the use of artificial intelligence. Recent researches have been developed to give computers a creativity ability as main objective. A type of related research is algorithmic composition. Traditionally evolutionary algorithms are successfully used for composing tasks, using a wide variety of fitness functions. This work presents a multiobjective approach that combines Fux's rules, from music theory, and functions that capture melodies' proportions, based on the Zipf's law, to compose monophonic melodies. Besides that, we propose a method that measures the amount of creativity contained in an algorithmic composition method. Experimental results show that the proposed methods have a good musical quality. © 2017 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Imaging objects in electrical impedance tomography (EIT) measurement are often in a dynamic evolution process, and exploiting the spatial-temporal properties for the dynamic reconstruction objects is crucial for the improvement of the reconstruction quality. In this paper, the linearized equation system for dynamic EIT is established based on spatio-temporal representation. Due to the spatial redundancy and the temporal correlations, the low-rank property of a two-dimensional difference image at a specific time window is introduced to objective functional. The Augmented Lagrange Multiplier (ALM) method is applied to solve the new objective functional. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is illustrated on both simulation and experiment data sets. © 2017 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Open access institutional repositories can be ill-equipped to manage the complexity of research outputs from departments of fine arts, media, drama, music, cultural heritage, and the creative arts in general. The U.K.-based Kultur project was funded to create a flexible multimedia repository model using EPrints software. The project launched the first arts based institutional repositories at the University of the Arts London and University for the Creative Arts. Ten years later, these pioneering repositories are still evolving in response to the needs of arts researchers, and in the context of rapid changes in the scholarly communications landscape. This article discusses the evolution of scholarly repositories in the creative arts, with the aim of reducing the under-representation of arts research in open access repositories. © 2017, Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC © 2017, © Stephanie Meece, Amy Robinson, and Marie-Therese Gramstadt.

ABSTRACT: In this study, we investigate software structure evolution and growth. We represent software structure by means of a generic macro-topology called Little House, which models the dependencies among classes of object-oriented software systems. We, then, define a stochastic model to predict the way software architectures evolve. The model estimates how the classes of object-oriented programs get connected one to another along the evolution of the systems. To define the model, we analyzed data from 81 versions of six Java based projects. We analyzed each pair of sequential versions, for each project, in order to depict a pattern of software structure evolution based on Little House. To evaluate the model, we performed two experiments: one with the data used to derive the model, and another with data of 35 releases, in total, of four open-source Java project. In both experiments, we found a very low rate of error for the application of the proposed model. The evaluation of the model suggests it is able to predict how a software structure will evolve. © 2017 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: This paper describes an evaluation conducted on the MetaCompose music generator, which is based on evolutionary computation and uses a hybrid evolutionary technique that combines FI-2POP and multi-objective optimization. The main objective of MetaCompose is to create music in real-time that can express different mood-states. The experiment presented here aims to evaluate: (i) if the perceived mood experienced by the participants of a music score matches intended mood the system is trying to express and (ii) if participants can identify transitions in the mood expression that occur mid-piece. Music clips including transitions and with static affective states were produced by MetaCompose and a quantitative user study was performed. Participants were tasked with annotating the perceived mood and moreover were asked to annotate in real-time changes in valence^ie data collected confirms the hypothesis that people can recognize changes in music mood and that MetaCompose can express perceptibly different levels of arousal. In regards to valence we observe that, while it is mainly perceived as expected, changes in arousal seems to also influence perceived valence, suggesting that one or more of the music features MetaCompose associates with arousal has some effect on valence as well. © 2017 ACM.

ABSTRACT: Background: Music therapy students negotiate a complex relationship with music and its use in clinical work throughout their education and training. This distinct, pervasive, and evolving relationship suggests a developmental process unique to music therapy. Objective: The purpose of this grounded theory study was to create a theoretical model of music therapy students' developmental process, beginning with a study within one large Midwestern university. Methods: Participants (N = 15) were music therapy students who completed one 60-minute intensive interview, followed by a 20-minute member check meeting. Recorded interviews were transcribed, analyzed, and coded using open and axial coding. Results: The theoretical model that emerged was a six-step sequential developmental progression that included the following themes: (a) Personal Connection, (b) Turning Point, (c) Adjusting Relationship with Music, (d) Growth and Development, (e) Evolution, and (f) Empowerment. The first three steps are linear; development continues in a cyclical process among the last three steps. As the cycle continues, music therapy students continue to grow and develop their skills, leading to increased empowerment, and more specifically, increased self-efficacy and competence. Conclusions: Further exploration of the model is needed to inform educators' and other key stakeholders' understanding of student needs and concerns as they progress through music therapy degree programs. © 2017 American Music Therapy Association.

ABSTRACT: This paper proposes a statistical analysis that captures similarities and differences between classical music composers with the eventual aim to understand why particular composers ‘sound’ different even if their ‘lineages’ (influences network) are similar or why they ‘sound’ alike if their ‘lineages’ are different. In order to do this we use statistical methods and measures of association or similarity (based on presence/absence of traits such as specific ‘ecological’ characteristics and personal musical influences) that have been developed in biosystematics, scientometrics, and bibliographic coupling. This paper also represents a first step towards a more ambitious goal of developing an evolutionary model of Western classical music. © 2017, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Synchronized movement is a ubiquitous feature of dance and music performance. Much research into the evolutionary origins of these cultural practices has focused on why humans perform rather than watch or listen to dance and music. In this study, we show that movement synchrony among a group of performers predicts the aesthetic appreciation of live dance performances. We developed a choreography that continuously manipulated group synchronization using a defined movement vocabulary based on arm swinging, walking and running. The choreography was performed live to four audiences, as we continuously tracked the performers’ movements, and the spectators’ affective responses. We computed dynamic synchrony among performers using cross recurrence analysis of data from wrist accelerometers, and implicit measures of arousal from spectators’ heart rates. Additionally, a subset of spectators provided continuous ratings of enjoyment and perceived synchrony using tablet computers. Granger causality analyses demonstrate predictive relationships between synchrony, enjoyment ratings and spectator arousal, if audiences form a collectively consistent positive or negative aesthetic evaluation. Controlling for the influence of overall movement acceleration and visual change, we show that dance communicates group coordination via coupled movement dynamics among a group of performers. Our findings are in line with an evolutionary function of dance–and perhaps all performing arts–in transmitting social signals between groups of people. Human movement is the common denominator of dance, music and theatre. Acknowledging the time-sensitive and immediate nature of the performer-spectator relationship, our study makes a significant step towards an aesthetics of joint actions in the performing arts. © 2017 Vicary et al.

ABSTRACT: Arguably, emotion is always valenced - either pleasant or unpleasant - and dependent on the pleasure system. This system serves adaptive evolutionary functions; relying on separable wanting, liking, and learning neural mechanisms mediated by mesocorticolimbic networks driving pleasure cycles with appetitive, consummatory, and satiation phases. Liking is generated in a small set of discrete hedonic hotspots and coldspots, while wanting is linked to dopamine and to larger distributed brain networks. Breakdown of the pleasure system can lead to anhedonia and other features of affective disorders. Eudaimonia and well-being are difficult to study empirically, yet whole-brain computational models could offer novel insights (e.g., routes to eudaimonia such as caregiving of infants or music) potentially linking eudaimonia to optimal metastability in the pleasure system. © ISRE and SAGE.

ABSTRACT: The past decade witnessed the dramatic evolution from Quality of Service (QoS) to Quality of Experience (QoE) in the design of wireless networks, especially on the aspect of link scheduling. In many applications, end users are concerned more about transmission quality of an individual task rather than the quality of a link, where a task may refer to a piece of music, video, etc. and may include many packets. This paper proposes a new network model aiming at improving user experience by pushing the scheduling problem to the task layer. A novel QoE requirement is designed to generalize the QoS requirements of a task, which is the ratio requirement. Following this design, a corresponding scheduling policy is proposed to capture it for each task and then reach an application-aware transmission allocation. We theoretically analyze the performance of the scheduling policy, and discuss the design of an optimal solution and the impact of the QoE requirements. Finally, the simulation results indicate that our scheduling policy can significantly improve QoE. © 2016 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Drugs are a rising problem with today teens. One of these up and coming substances is ectasy. Properly known as MDMA (methyldioxymethamphetamine), is most commonly used at clubes, raves, and atmospheres where there are a lot of people and loud music. MDMA commonly known as ectasy, is a psychoactive drug used as a recreational drug. Desidered effects of its abuse include empathy, euphoria and heightened sensations. When taken by mouth effects begin after 30-45 minutes and lasts 3-5 hours. Adverse effects of MDMA use include addiction, memory problems, paranoia, difficulty sleeping, blurred vision, sweating and a rapid heartbeat. Use may also lead to depression and fatigue. Deaths have been reported due to increased body temperature and dehydration. MDMA influences in neurotransmitters serotonin. MDMA generally is illegal in most countries. In general, MDMA users begin reporting effects within 30 to 50 minutes of consumption. The most serious short-term physical health risks of MDMA are hyperthermia and dehydration. Cases of life-threatening or fatal hyponatremia (excessively low sodium concentration in the blood) have developed in MDMA users attemping to prevent dehydration by consuming excessive amount of water without replenishing electrolytes. MDMA overdose intoxication symptoms vary widely due to the involvement of multiple organ system. In most fatalities MDMA was not the only drug involved. Acute toxicity is mainly caused by serotonin syndrome and sympthomimetic effects. MDMA's toxicity in overdose may be exacerbated by caffeine, with which it is frequently cut (mixed with to increase volume). Caffeine provokes adverse interactions with MDMA ectasy. Polydipsia is another mechanism of hyponatremia after ectasy ingestion. During April 2016, four patients commingfrom an electronic party were assisted at the Emergentology servicefrom the "Juan Fernandez" hospital from the city of Buenos Aires. The clinical features of these patients are described, and the treatment and the evolution observed, are documented.

ABSTRACT: This paper provides an integrative review of neuroscientific and biobehavioral evidence about the effects of dance on the individual across cultural differences. Dance moves us, and many derive aesthetic pleasure from it. However, in addition—and beyond aesthetics—we propose that dance has noteworthy, deeper neurobiological effects. We first summarize evidence that illustrates the centrality of dance to human life indirectly from archaeology, comparative psychology, developmental psychology, and cross-cultural psychology. Second, we review empirical evidence for six neural and biobehavioral functions of dance: (1) attentional focus/flow, (2) basic emotional experiences, (3) imagery, (4) communication, (5) self-intimation, and (6) social cohesion. We discuss the reviewed evidence in relation to current debates in the field of empirical enquiry into the functions of human dance, questioning the positions that dance is (1) just for pleasure, (2) all about sex, (3) just for mood management and well-being, and (4) for experts only. Being a young field, evidence is still piecemeal and inconclusive. This review aims to take a step toward a systematization of an emerging avenue of research: a neuro- and biobehavioral science of dance. © 2017 New York Academy of Sciences.

ABSTRACT: Although a nineteenth-century Spanish tale, Nib Maria Fabra's "Cuatro siglos de buen gobierno" [Four Centuries of Good Governance, 1883], was among the first examples of alternate history, this subgenre has not been widely cultivated in Spain until contemporary times. In our century, the alternate worlds imagined by Keith Roberts or Kingsley Amis- in which the Spanish Empire prevailed- have found a Spanish equivalent in Eduardo Vaquerizo's work. His novels Danza de tinieblas [Dance of Darkness, 2005] and Memoria de tinieblas [Memory of Darkness, 2013], as well as several short stories, establish a consistent alternate universe within which Fabra's positivist ideal of an enduring Spanish Empire acquires features that can be illuminating if compared to the "Rule Britannia" scenarios popular in English fiction. Vaquerizo's world in the TmlrBMs series has been adopted by other writers in a shared fictional universe, showing the importance of these novels in the evolution of alternate history in Spain.

ABSTRACT: Eucalyptus and Pine suspensions flow in a pipe was studied experimentally and numerically. Pressure drop was measured for different mean inlet flow velocities. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT), was used to evaluate the prevailing flow regime. Fibers concentration distribution in the pipe cross section and plug evolution were inferred from EIT tomographic images. A modified low-Reynolds-number k-μ turbulence model was applied to simulate the flow of pulp suspensions. The accuracy of the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) predictions was significantly reduced when data in plug regime was simulated. The CFD model applied was initially developed to simulate the flow of Eucalyptus and Pine suspensions in fully turbulent flow regime. Using this model to simulate data in the plug regime leads to an excessive attenuation of turbulence which leads to lower values of pressure drop than the experimental ones. For transition flow regime, the CFD model could be applied successfully to simulate the flow data, similar to what happens for the turbulent regime. Copyright © 2017 by ASME.

ABSTRACT: Sexual traits (e.g. visual ornaments, acoustic signals, courtship behaviour) are often displayed together as multimodal signals. Some hypotheses predict joint evolution of different sexual signals (e.g. to increase the efficiency of communication) or that different signals trade off with each other (e.g. due to limited resources). Alternatively, multiple signals may evolve independently for different functions, or to communicate different information (multiple message hypothesis). We evaluated these hypotheses with a comparative study in the family Estrildidae, one of the largest songbird radiations, and one that includes many model species for research in sexual selection and communication. We found little evidence for either joint evolution or trade-offs between song and colour ornamentation. Some negative correlations between dance repertoire and song traits may suggest a functional compromise, but generally courtship dance also evolved independently from other signals. Instead of correlated evolution, we found that song, dance and colour are each related to different socio-ecological traits. Song complexity evolved together with ecological generalism, song performance with investment in reproduction, dance with commonness and habitat type, whereas colour ornamentation was shown previously to correlate mostly with gregariousness. We conclude that multimodal signals evolve in response to various socio-ecological traits, suggesting the accumulation of distinct signalling functions. © 2017 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

ABSTRACT: One of the substantial tasks of opinion mining is to find semantic orientation and intensity of opinion words and phrases. This research tries to find numeric values for sentiment words and phrases by introducing a novel algorithm. The opinion about an object or its aspects is often expressed through sentiment phrases, and having a measure of quantification for them is essential for processing sentiments. In simple terms, semantic orientation or opinion intensity is a building block of opinion mining. This paper tries to (i) identify the sentiment phrases, and (ii) by means of a memetic algorithm, assign scores to each phrase and build a sentiment lexicon. This score shows the place of the phrase on a spectrum, ranging from very negative to very positive (0 to 10). The proposed method assigns real numbers to sentiment phrases and these scores show the intensity of each sentiment phrase. Three datasets were created and used in this paper: Movie, Music and Camera datasets which consist of reviews in each category. The intensity and polarity of words are calculated for each database, and compared to each other. The results show that (i) some words are not as positive or negative as previously thought; (ii) what is the effect of using adverbs, such as 'very' and 'not'; and (iii) sentiment phrases in different contexts have different intensities. © 2017 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: All human societies have music with a rhythmic “beat,” typically produced with percussive instruments such as drums. The set of capacities that allows humans to produce and perceive music appears to be deeply rooted in human biology, but an understanding of its evolutionary origins requires cross-taxa comparisons. We show that drumming by palm cockatoos (Probosciger aterrimus) shares the key rudiments of human instrumental music, including manufacture of a sound tool, performance in a consistent context, regular beat production, repeated components, and individual styles. Over 131 drumming sequences produced by 18 males, the beats occurred at nonrandom, regular intervals, yet individual males differed significantly in the shape parameters describing the distribution of their beat patterns, indicating individual drumming styles. Autocorrelation analyses of the longest drumming sequences further showed that they were highly regular and predictable like human music. These discoveries provide a rare comparative perspective on the evolution of rhythmicity and instrumental music in our own species, and show that a preference for a regular beat can have other origins before being co-opted into group-based music and dance.

ABSTRACT: Objectives: The present research aims to: (1) evaluate the extent to which four individual music therapy sessions are associated with changes in the self-efficacy, emotions, and self-concept of adolescents hospitalized in a hematology–oncology unit; (2) document the adolescents’ experience of music therapy. Method: Seven adolescents, between the ages of 12 and 18, participated in interactive music therapy sessions, which involved learning how to play a song on the classical guitar. The research plan included seven measurement times. Following the last session of the intervention, each adolescent answered three open-ended questions about their overall experience in music therapy. Non-parametric and thematic analyses were carried out on the results we obtained in order to identify the improvements associated with the intervention. Results: The results obtained at the group level did not show systematic changes although important individual differences were found. Positive developments were observed in 2/7 participants in self-efficacy, 3/7 on positive emotions, 2/7 on negative emotions, and 3/7 regarding their self-concept. The adolescents’ comments highlighted an overall positive experience marked by physical and/or psychological well-being. Conclusion: These results promote the implementation of new research on the effects of interactive music therapy interventions on adolescents who are hospitalized in hematology–oncology units by considering the individual trajectories in the groups concerned. © 2017, Lavoisier.

ABSTRACT: Humans and other species have biologically endowed abilities for discriminating quantities. A widely accepted view sees such abilities as an evolved capacity specific for number and arithmetic. This view, however, is based on an implicit teleological rationale, builds on inaccurate conceptions of biological evolution, downplays human data from non-industrialized cultures, overinterprets results from trained animals, and is enabled by loose terminology that facilitates teleological argumentation. A distinction between quantical (e.g., quantity discrimination) and numerical (exact, symbolic) cognition is needed: quantical cognition provides biologically evolved preconditions for numerical cognition but it does not scale up to number and arithmetic, which require cultural mediation. The argument has implications for debates about the origins of other special capacities – geometry, music, art, and language. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Sirens became an essential element of the literary imagination in many European literatures in Romanticism and have remained popular ever since. Also, in Russian and Polish culture, the image of the dangerously alluring and transgressive female nymph called "rusalka" is omnipresent. In this paper, the authors use a comparative approach to trace the evolution of the "rusalka" motif from its creation in the Romantic period to its transformed (and often highly sexualized) use in present-day popular culture. From works written by Pushkin, Lermontov, Mickiewicz as well as Bal'mont and Gumilev (amongst others), we move on to contemporary actualizations of the motif in the music videos and lyrics of a Russian girl group, a Polish pop performer (Doda Elektroda) and a Russian folk-metal band ("Alkonost"). We argue that the centuries-old popularity of the "rusalka" motif can be ascribed to the theme's core semantics of female transgression and adaptability that lends itself especially well to the sphere of pop and its remixing and resignifying practices. © 2017 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest.

ABSTRACT: Maternally inherited bacterial endosymbionts are common in many arthropod species. Some endosymbionts cause female-biased sex ratio distortion in their hosts that can result in profound changes to a host's mating behaviour and reproductive biology. Dance flies (Diptera: Empidinae) are well known for their unusual reproductive biology, including species with female-specific ornamentation and female-biased lek-like swarming behaviour. The cause of the repeated evolution of female ornaments in these flies remains unknown, but is probably associated with female-biased sex ratios in individual species. In this study we assessed whether dance flies harbour sex ratio distorting endosymbionts that might have driven these mating system evolutionary changes. We measured the incidence and prevalence of infection by three endosymbionts that are known to cause female-biased sex ratios in other insect hosts (Wolbachia, Rickettsia and Spiroplasma) across 20 species of dance flies. We found evidence of widespread infection by all three symbionts and variation in sex-specific prevalence across the taxa sampled. However, there was no relationship between infection prevalence and adult sex ratio measures and no evidence that female ornaments are associated with high prevalences of sex-biased symbiont infections. We conclude that the current distribution of endosymbiont infections is unlikely to explain the diversity in mating systems among dance fly species. ©2017 Murray et al.

ABSTRACT: Sarasvati assumes different roles, a physical river and a river goddess, then as a goddess of speech and finally that of a goddess of learning, knowledge, arts and music. References to Sarasvati in the Vedas and the Brahmanas, the Mahabharata and the Puranas and her marked presence in other religious orders, such as Buddhism, Jainism and the Japanese religion, form the basis of discussion as regards her various attributes and manifestations. In Jainism, her counter-part is Sutra-devi, in Buddhism it is Manjusri and Prajnaparamita and in the Japanese religion, Benten is the representative goddess. The physical presence of Sarasvati in various iconic forms is seen in Nepal, Tibet and Japan. Tantrism associated with Sarasvati also finds reflection in these religious traditions. Sculptors and art historians take delight in interpreting various symbols her iconic forms represent. The book examines Sarasvati's origin, the course of her flow and the place of her disappearance in a holistic manner. Based on a close analysis of texts from the early Rig-Veda to the Brahmanas and the Puranas, it discusses different view-points in a balanced perspective and attempts to drive the discussions towards the emergence of a consensus view. The author delineates the various phases of Sarasvati's evolution to establish her unique status and emphasise her continued relevance in the Hindu tradition. The book argues that the practice of pilgrimage further evolved after its association with the river Sarasvati who was perceived as divinity personified in Hindu tradition. This, in turn, led to the emergence of numerous pilgrimage sites on or near her banks which attracted a large number of pilgrims. A multifaceted and interdisciplinary analysis of a Hindu goddess, this book will be of interest to academics researching South Asian Religion, Hinduism and Indian Philosophy as also the general readers. © 2017 R.U.S. Prasad.

ABSTRACT: This paper explores the collaboration networks of Finnish metal music genre superstars, the evolution of these networks through time and the importance of geographical scale in their evolution. The article, therefore, aims to shed light upon how successful creative teams network: locally (local buzz) and/or globally (global pipelines). The contemporary literature on economic geography underlines the importance of the local scene and of geographical proximity for the creative industries, such as the music industry. The illustrative cases presented here–considered to be superstars in terms of their record sales–provide evidence that if local networks and buzz are present in the home localities of the bands, as is common in urban environments, they take advantage of these collaboration possibilities. However, bands located in smaller more peripheral localities can substitute for the lack of local buzz with global pipelines. Consequently, the results suggest that, for successful bands, the importance of local buzz is not as marked as would be expected based on the earlier literature. Therefore, the findings challenge, at least to a certain degree, the views of the heightened importance of geographical proximity for the creative music industry: instead, superstars collaborate to a large extent through global pipelines. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: We report lessons from iteratively developing a music recognition system to enable a wide range of musicians to embed musical codes into their typical performance practice. The musician composes fragments of music that can be played back with varying levels of embellishment, disguise and looseness to trigger digital interactions. We collaborated with twenty-three musicians, spanning professionals to amateurs and working with a variety of instruments. We chart the rapid evolution of the system to meet their needs as they strove to integrate music recognition technology into their performance practice, introducing multiple features to enable them to trade-off reliability with musical expression. Collectively, these support the idea of deliberately introducing 'looseness' into interactive systems by addressing the three key challenges of control, feedback and attunement, and highlight the potential role for written notations in other recognition-based systems. © 2017 ACM.

ABSTRACT: In art and music, time periods like "classical" and "impressionist" are powerful means for academics and practitioners to compare and contrast artifacts that share aesthetics or philosophies. While web designs have undergone changes for 25 years, we lack theories to describe or explain these changes. In this paper, we take a first step towards identifying and understanding the design periods of websites. Drawing from humanistic HCI methods, subject experts of web design critically analyzed a dataset of prominent websites whose lifetimes span over a decade. These informed judgments reveal a set of key markers that signal shifts in design periods. For instance, advances in display technologies and changes in company strategies help explain how design periods demarcated by particular layout templates and navigation models arise. We suggest that designers and marketers can draw inspiration from website designs curated into design periods. Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

ABSTRACT: Musicalizatech was a project that promoted music creation and production among students of Secondary and High Schools, fostering at the same time creativity, the use of technology, and collaborative and informal learning. A total of 46 participants from Secondary Education and High Schools in Seville and Cordoba, grouped in fifteen pre-formed bands, joined the project. This study used mixed methods; the main instruments were individual questionnaires and a focus group. The study also included the analysis of the different versions of the songs and their evolution, the participants’ individual contributions to an online private diary and their interactions within a customized designed online platform. Results showed a clear impact on participants in different areas: development of social and emotional skills, ability to problem solving and work in teams, development of technological skills and clear improvements in the process of musical creation. © 2017 Intellect Ltd Article.

ABSTRACT: To trigger positive consumer responses, retailers spend large sums of money on arousing and entertaining store environment designs that do not always produce the desired positive consumer reactions. The current research provides a theoretical framework that offers an alternate explanation for shopper preferences regarding retail environments. Drawing on consumers' need for an environment that promotes understanding, this study indicates the importance of communicating a coherent store environment to effect store satisfaction and re-patronage intention. Harmonious store environments facilitate understanding and comprehension; they enhance information processing and pleasure judgment. One laboratory experiment and one field experiment tested the proposed research framework. Insights from evolutionary and aesthetic psychology, consumer behavior research, and the Asian practice of Feng Shui all guided the manipulation of music and aesthetic design variables to create atmospheric harmony. The findings of both studies suggest that harmonious store environments increase pleasure and positively impact shopping satisfaction and re-patronage intent, as mediated by shopping value. These findings offer a new perspective for creating pleasant store environments. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The Carnival is the most peculiar celebration of Cadiz and one of the most unique manifestations of its modality in the world. A phenomenon that is based mainly on the couplets, the ingenuity of their lyrics and the variety of music, each year new and different; The Carnival of Cadiz is inspired by real life, in the archetypal images of tradition, theater and cinema, in legends, operas or zarzuelas. Another of its specificities is the disguises, which in Cadiz they are known as tipos, more than a set of garments, is the materialization of the character represented by each group. The evolution of the type, which is directly related to the theme of its repertoire, has run parallel to the succession of real events, literary, artistic, social, cinematographic, television and other Media channels. The Carnival of Cádiz has been adopting innovative styles from its own evolution and others acquired from different Carnivals. In this sense, the geostrategic situation of the city, in the south of the south of Europe, and close to Africa, but above all of its port, has been fundamental for the maritime communications between the two shores of the Atlantic. The exchange of goods and passengers brings the introduction of customs, Carnival itself, through the genovese merchants who established their businesses in the city, or the African rhythms contributed by the slaves in their passage from Africa to the new American lands. In the coming and going by the Atlantic Ocean, the coplas returned with Havana cadences and other Antillean compasses that added to the cantes of the earth. Although its appearance is very old, it was the assumption of its organization at the end of the 19th century, by the municipal authority which leaves a documentary trace of how this festival has been conforming a style of Cadiz in which the coplas∗union of Lyrics rhymed with music, each year new and different, constitute the most significant and differentiating axis with respect to other Carnivals of the world. The expression of the Carnival of Cadiz has evolved according to historical events, social changes, musical tendencies, theatrical or film premieres and, in the last decades, by television and new media. The evolution of the Carnival of Cadiz has not occurred in an automatic or continuous way. After almost two centuries of history, everything suggests that this rhythmic movement that transports the images of the Caribbean peoples to the other side of the ocean and becomes Carnival in Cadiz, will continue to remember the permanent linkage, across the Atlantic, that unites the Shores of East and West through its waters turned into a mirror in which customs, characters and cultures are reflected.

ABSTRACT: ‘Lockout laws’ are not new in Australia – variants exist and have been trialled or continue to operate in Newcastle (since 2008), Melbourne (abandoned in 2008), and Adelaide (since 2013) and Darwin (since 2007). In February 2014, the New South Wales O’Farrell Coalition government introduced 1.30 am lockout and 3 am last drink laws for the Sydney CBD (Central Business District), among a series of other measures. The subsequent controversies about the ‘lockout laws’ in Sydney have provoked a curious and vivid set of debates encompassing crime, medical, moral, social, libertarian, cultural and industrial discourses. In this paper I wish to assess the new regulatory landscape within historical and contemporary perspectives of nightlife economies increasingly privileging cultural and entertainment city uses. Beyond unpacking the ‘lockout’ debate in terms of ‘liveability’ and ‘cultural city’ meanings as practised by Australian cities, this article will focus on the implications for Sydney’s ability to maintain its national and global status as a music city. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group

ABSTRACT: According to a traditional view, the specific diet in vertebrates is one of the key factors structuring the composition of the gut microbiota. In this interpretation, the microbiota assumes a subordinate position, where the larger host shapes, through evolution and its fitness, the taxonomical composition of the hosted microbiota. The present contribution shows how the evolution of herbivory, framed within the new concept of holobiont, the possibility of inter-kingdom crosstalk and its epigenetic effects, could pave the way to a completely reversed interpretation: instead of being passively shaped, the microbiota can mold and shape the general host body structure to increase its fitness. Central elements to consider in this context are the inter-kingdom crosstalk, the possibility of transporting RNAs through nanovesicles in feces from parents to offspring, and the activation of epigenetic processes passed on vertically from generation to generation. The new hypothesis is that the gut microbiota could play a great role in the macroevolutionary dynamics of herbivorous vertebrates, causing directly through host-microbiota dialog of epigenetic nature (i.e., methylation, histone acetylation, etc.), major changes in the organisms phenotype. The vertical exchange of the same microbial communities from parents to offspring, the interaction of these microbes with fairly uniform genotypes, and the socially restricted groups where these processes take place, could all explain the reasons why herbivory has appeared several time (and independently) during the evolution of vertebrates. The new interpretation could also represent a key factor in understanding the convergent evolution of analogous body structures in very distant lineages.

ABSTRACT: The development of transversal and multilateral skills in today's students is a major focus point in integrative and sustainable education. In Romania, physical education is a subject that fosters the multilateral development of students' personality, as dance-specific methods are structured into ways to prevent, relax or train major functions. They are thought to play a significant part in prophylactics, as well as at a therapeutic level. Thus, the purpose of our research is to identify the best strategies which can result in an efficient means of finding adequate physical education activities by diversifying the existing means and introducing dancing during lessons. For a period of three months, a group of 30 students (aged seven to ten ± one and a half years) took part in a work programme that involved two sessions a week and mainly included dance-specific methods. The subjects were tested before and after taking part in the work programme, and the tests dealt with the evolution of coordination, flexibility and strength in the lower limbs and the abdomen. The statistical analysis was performed with the SPSS v.21 software. The results validated the research programme, and the data indicated major progress in all trials, with a difference p<0.05 between initial and final averages. According to the results, dance classes may be included in the school curriculum or as an optional subject, and the students' enthusiasm for dancing may become a pleasant educational activity, thus meeting the goals of physical education. © Peter Lang GmbH Internationaler Verlag der Wissenschaften Frankfurt am Main 2017 All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: This conclusion presents an overview of the present status of nanoelectronics, its challenges, its foreseen evolution, and its wide field of applications. Today people have in smartphones many times the computing power and the memory of those mainframe computers, at a small fraction of the cost, and with added functionalities, like connection capability, high resolution cameras, music and video reproduction, navigation, and plenty of services. This example shows also how the semiconductor technology, originally developed for processor and memories, has been capable to extend to other fields, allowing the low cost realization of sensors, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and solid-state power devices. New cross-functional education paradigms are needed to form the next generation of innovators in the field of nanoelectronics. The importance of nanoelectronics has been recognized by the European Commission that has listed it among the key enabling technologies (KET) for future economic and social development. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.KGaA.

ABSTRACT: The aim of this contribution is to broaden the concept of musical meaning from an abstract and emotionally neutral cognitive representation to an emotion-integrating description that is related to the evolutionary approach to music. Starting from the dispositional machinery for dealing with music as a temporal and sounding phenomenon, musical emotions are considered as adaptive responses to be aroused in human beings as the product of neural structures that are specialized for their processing. A theoretical and empirical background is provided in order to bring together the findings of music and emotion studies and the evolutionary approach to musical meaning. The theoretical grounding elaborates on the transition from referential to affective semantics, the distinction between expression and induction of emotions, and the tension between discrete-digital and analog-continuous processing of the sounds. The empirical background provides evidence from several findings such as infant-directed speech, referential emotive vocalizations and separation calls in lower mammals, the distinction between the acoustic and vehicle mode of sound perception, and the bodily and physiological reactions to the sounds. It is argued, finally, that early affective processing reflects the way emotions make our bodies feel, which in turn reflects on the emotions expressed and decoded. As such there is a dynamic tension between nature and nurture, which is reflected in the nature-nurture-nature cycle of musical sense-making. © 2017 Reybrouck and Eerola.

ABSTRACT: In an increasingly technologically driven world, there is proliferate discussion among education and government authorities about the necessity to rethink education in the twenty-first century. The evolution of technology and its pervasive influence on the needs and requirements of society is central to this mindset. Innovations in online applications and social networking capabilities have accelerated in accessibility and popularity. As technological devices become commonplace, it is understandable that curriculum documents and education policies around the globe are littered with statements about Information and Communication Technology (ICT) expectations and achievement level standards. There is no argument about the presence of technology or that it should be embedded in education. However, there is a case to be made about revealing the potential of technology for teaching and learning and the necessary associated pedagogical considerations. This article explores the outcomes of an online music education project used in a blended learning context to provide high quality music learning resources to Australian rural and remote schools. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: This paper provides the first detailed study of the links between celebrity-fan communication networks and philanthropy in the People’s Republic of China. It explains how the evolution of the Chinese Internet, and especially the rise of social media, has created new spaces in which fans of entertainment celebrities may be induced to engage with philanthropic causes. It then outlines the history of Chinese fan-driven philanthropic initiatives centred on people who became famous through reality-television popular music competitions. Finally, it offers a case study of the initiatives connected to popstar Li Yuchun, and examines the rationales provided by fans in online forums and interviews for their philanthropic engagement. Critics of celebrity-inspired philanthropy highlight its supposedly inauthentic and passive nature. Yet we find that fans actively exploit the forms of sociality that are provided by celebrity-fan communication networks, both to establish virtual participatory communities and to generate social action in the form of non-government-organised volunteering. © 2017 Asian Studies Association of Australia.

ABSTRACT: We present the results of a numerical benchmark study for the MUltidimensional Stellar Implicit Code (MUSIC) based on widely applicable two- and three-dimensional compressible hydrodynamics problems relevant to stellar interiors. MUSIC is an implicit large eddy simulation code that uses implicit time integration, implemented as a Jacobian-free Newton Krylov method. A physics based preconditioning technique which can be adjusted to target varying physics is used to improve the performance of the solver. The problems used for this benchmark study include the Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities, and the decay of the Taylor-Green vortex. Additionally we show a test of hydrostatic equilibrium, in a stellar environment which is dominated by radiative effects. In this setting the flexibility of the preconditioning technique is demonstrated. This work aims to bridge the gap between the hydrodynamic test problems typically used during development of numerical methods and the complex flows of stellar interiors. A series of multidimensional tests were performed and analysed. Each of these test cases was analysed with a simple, scalar diagnostic, with the aim of enabling direct code comparisons. As the tests performed do not have analytic solutions, we verify MUSIC by comparing it to established codes including ATHENA and the PENCIL code. MUSIC is able to both reproduce behaviour from established and widely-used codes as well as results expected from theoretical predictions. This benchmarking study concludes a series of papers describing the development of the MUSIC code and provides confidence in future applications. © ESO, 2017.

ABSTRACT: This article develops a method for interpreting Béla Bartók's early tonal practice that supposes a conceptual shift from a relatively historically static major-minor tonality to a multivalent, "evolving" tonality in which works express individual variations on abstract, communal ideas of key. Starting with Edward Gollin's recent generalization of Moritz Hauptmann's key representations as "multiaggregate cycles"-which he also uncovers on the surface of and in the relations between harmonies in Bartók's music-The article briefly reconsiders Hauptmann's theories and depictions and then elaborates on the relation between those key depictions and multiaggregate cycles. Ultimately, it argues that augmented and diminished triads-The harmonies disjunctive to the alternating major and minor thirds that generate Hauptmann's representations- form the primary basis for Bartók's multiaggregate cycles and that these "(048) or (0369) chains" exemplify augmented and diminished tendencies propelling the development of new key variations. By way of demonstration, the article ends with several analyses of Bartók's works from the decade 1908-17: The first movement of the Second String Quartet (1914-17), "Three Autumn Teardrops" from the Five Songs, op. 16 (1916), the fourth of the Four Dirges (1910), and the Tenth Bagatelle (1908). © 2017 by Yale University.

ABSTRACT: Music discovery in everyday situations has been facilitated in recent years by audio content recognition services such as Shazam. The widespread use of such services has produced a wealth of user data, specifying where and when a global audience takes action to learn more about music playing around them. Here, we analyze a large collection of Shazam queries of popular songs to study the relationship between the timing of queries and corresponding musical content. Our results reveal that the distribution of queries varies over the course of a song, and that salient musical events drive an increase in queries during a song. Furthermore, we find that the distribution of queries at the time of a song's release differs from the distribution following a song's peak and subsequent decline in popularity, possibly reflecting an evolution of user intent over the "life cycle" of a song. Finally, we derive insights into the data size needed to achieve consistent query distributions for individual songs. The combined findings of this study suggest that music discovery behavior, and other facets of the human experience of music, can be studied quantitatively using large-scale industrial data. © 2017 Kaneshiro, Ruan, Baker and Berger.

ABSTRACT: In Korea, arts and culture in the provinces are at a disadvantage in many aspects. We examine the difficulties of being a provincial dance organization. We analyze the strategies to overcome these difficulties and the resulting process of the co-evolution of a department of dance at a provincial university and its offshoot dance company. In their endeavor for survival, these dance organizations seek to be a part of the community with community dance programs that induce the participation of residents. The resulting values created in the community of the Western District of Daejeon City and the success factors of these organizations are also analyzed. Some implications of the co-evolutionary process to other provincial dance organizations are discussed. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.
